12 INTRODUCTION

F

rom the time that goods
and services began to be
traded in early civilizations,
people have been thinking about
business. The emergence of
specialized producers and the use
of money as a means of exchange
were methods by which individuals
and societies could, in modern
terms, gain a “business edge.” The
ancient Egyptians, the Mayans, the
Greeks, and the Romans all knew
that wealth creation through the
mechanism of commerce was
fundamental to the acquisition of
power, and formed the base on
which civilization could prosper.
The lessons of the early traders
resonate even today. Specialism
revealed the beneﬁts of economies

The art of administration
is as old as the
human race.
Edward D. Jones
US investment banker
(1893–1982)

of scale—that production costs fall
as more items are produced. Money
gave rise to the concept of “value
added”—selling an item for more
than it cost to produce. Even when
barter was the norm, producers still
knew it was advantageous to lower
costs and raise the value of goods.
Today’s companies may use different
technologies and trade on a global
scale, but the essence of business
has changed little in millennia.

An era of change
However, the study of business as
an activity in its own right emerged
relatively recently. The terms
“manager” and “management” did
not appear in the English language
until the late 16th century. In his
1977 text The Visible Hand, Dr.
Alfred Chandler divided business
history into two periods: pre-1850
and post-1850. Before 1850 local,
family-owned ﬁrms dominated the
business environment. With
commerce operating on a relatively
small scale, little thought was given
to the wider disciplines of business.
The growth of the railroads in
the mid-1800s, followed by the
Industrial Revolution, enabled
businesses to grow beyond the
immediate gaze of friends or family,
and outside the immediate locale.
To prosper in this new—and

increasingly international—
environment businesses needed
different, and more rigorous,
processes and structures. The
geographic scope and ever-growing
size of these evolving businesses
required new levels of coordination
and communication—in short,
businesses needed management.

Managing production
The initial focus of the new breed
of manager was on production.
As manufacturing moved from
individual craftsmen to machinery,
and as ever-greater scale was
required, theorists such as Henri
Fayol examined ever-more-efﬁcient
ways of operating. The theories
of Scientiﬁc Management, chieﬂy
formulated by Frederick Taylor,
suggested that there was “one best
way” to perform a task. Businesses
were organized by precise routines,
and the role of the worker was simply
to supervise and “feed” machinery,
as though they were part of it. With
the advent of production lines
in the early 1900s, business was
characterized by standardization
and mass production.
While Henry Ford’s Model T car
is seen as a major accomplishment
of industrialization, Ford also
remarked “why is it every time I ask
for a pair of hands, they come with

INTRODUCTION 13

a brain attached?” Output may have
increased, but so too did conﬂict
between management and staff.
Working conditions were poor and
businesses ignored the sociological
context of work—productivity
mattered more than people.

Studying people
In the 1920s a new inﬂuence on
business thinking emerged—the
Human Relations Movement of
behavioral studies. Through the
work of psychologists Elton Mayo
and Abraham Maslow, businesses
began to recognize the value of
human relations. Workers were no
longer seen as simply “cogs in the
machine,” but as individuals with
unique needs. Managers still
focused on efﬁciency, but realized
that workers were more productive
when their social and emotional
needs were taken care of. For the
ﬁrst time, job design, workplace
environments, teamwork,
remuneration, and nonﬁnancial
beneﬁts were all considered
important to staff motivation.
In the period following World
War II, business practice shifted
again. Wartime innovation had
yielded signiﬁcant technological
advances that could be applied
to commerce. Managers began to
utilize quantitative analysis, and

were able to make use of computers
to help solve operational problems.
Human relations were not forgotten,
but in management thinking,
measurability returned to the fore.

Global brands
The postwar period saw the
growth of multinationals and
conglomerates—businesses with
multiple and diverse interests
across the globe. The war had made
the world seem smaller, and had
paved the way for the global brand.
These newly emerging global
brands grew as a result of a media
revolution—television, magazines,
and newspapers gave businesses

Entrepreneurship is about
survival, which nurtures
creative thinking. Business
is not ﬁnancial science, it’s
about trading—buying
and selling.
Anita Roddick
UK entrepreneur (1942–2007)

the means to reach a mass
audience. Businesses had always
used advertising to inform
customers about products and to
persuade them to buy, but mass
media provided the platform for
a new, and much broader, ﬁeld—
marketing. In the 1940s US
advertising executive Rosser Reeves
promoted the value of a Unique
Selling Proposition. By the 1960s,
marketing methods had shifted
from simply telling customers about
products to listening to what
customers wanted, and adapting
products and services to suit that.
Initially, marketing had its critics.
In the early 1960s hype about the
product became more important
than quality, and customers grew
dissatisﬁed with empty claims.
This, and competition from
Japanese manufacturers, had
Western companies embracing a
new form of business thinking:
Total Quality Management (TQM)
and Zero Defects management.
Guided by management theorists,
such as W. Edwards Demming and
Philip B. Crosby, quality was seen
as the responsibility of the entire
company, not just those on the
production line. Combining Human
Relations thinking and the
customer-focused approach of
marketing, many companies ❯❯

14 INTRODUCTION

adopted the Japanese philosophy of
kaizen: “continuous improvement of
everything, by everyone.” Staff at
all levels was tasked with improving
processes and products through
“quality circles.” While TQM is no
longer the buzzword it once was,
quality remains important. The
modern iteration of TQM is Six
Sigma, an approach to process
improvement that was developed
by Motorola in 1986 and adapted by
Jack Welch during his time as CEO
of General Electric.

Gurus and thinkers
Business history itself emerged
as a topic of study in the 1970s.
Dr. Alfred Chandler progressed
the study of business history from
the purely descriptive to the
analytical—his course at Harvard
Business School stressed the
importance of organizational
capabilities, technological
innovation, and continuous
learning. Taking their cue from
Chandler, in the 1980s and 1990s
management experts—such as
Michael Porter, Igor Ansoff,
Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Henry
Mintzberg, and Peter Drucker—
encouraged businesses to consider
their environments, to consider
the needs of people, and to remain
adaptable to change. Maintaining

the conditions for business growth,
and the correct positioning of
products within their market, were
considered key to business strategy.
Moreover, what distinguished these
gurus from their predecessors—who
had tended to focus on operational
issues—was a focus on leadership
itself. For example, Charles Handy’s
The Empty Raincoat revealed the
paradoxes of leadership, and
acknowledged the vulnerabilities
and fragilities of the managers
themselves. Leadership in the
context of business, these writers
recognized, is no easy undertaking.

Digital pioneering
Just as television and mass media
had done before, the growth of the
Internet in the 1990s and early

Business can be a source

and Jerry’s ice cream (1951–)

2000s heralded a new era for
business. While early hype led to
the failure of many online start-ups
in the dot-com bubble of 1997 to
2000, the successful e-commerce
pioneers laid the foundations for a
business landscape that would be
dominated by innovation. From
high-tech garage start-ups—such
as Hewlett-Packard and Apple—
to the websites, mobile apps, and
social-media forums of the modern
business environment, technology
is increasingly vital for business.
The explosion of new
businesses thanks to technology
also helped to expand the
availability of ﬁnance. During the
1980s and 1990s ﬁnance had grown
into a distinct discipline. Corporate
mergers and high-proﬁle takeovers
became a way for businesses to
grow beyond their operational
limits; leverage joined marketing
and strategy as part of the
management lexicon. In the late
1990s this expanded to venture
capital: the funding of small
companies by proﬁt-seeking
investors. The risk of starting and
running a business remains, but
the opportunities afforded by
technology and easier access to
ﬁnance have made taking the ﬁrst
step a little easier. With microﬁnance, and the support of online

INTRODUCTION 15

networks and communities of likeminded people dispensing
business advice, enterprise has
never been more entrepreneurial.
Recent business thinking has
brought diversity and social
responsibility to the fore. Businesses
are encouraged, and increasingly
required by law, to employ people
from diverse backgrounds and to
act in an ethical manner, wherever
they operate in the world.
Businesses such Nike and Adidas
require suppliers to prove that labor
conditions in their factories meet
required standards. Sustainability,
recycling, diversity, and
environmentalism have entered
business thinking alongside
strategic management and risk.

New horizons
If business thinking has shifted,
so too has the nature of business
itself. Where once a company was
constrained by its locality, today
the opportunities are truly global.
Globalization does, however, mean
that business is more competitive
than ever. Emerging markets are
creating new opportunities and
new threats. They may be able to
outsource production to low-cost
countries, but as their economies
grow, these emerging nations are
breeding new competition. China,

for example, may be “the world’s
factory,” but its home-grown
companies are also starting to
represent a threat to Western
businesses. As the global recession
of 2007–08 and ongoing economic
uncertainty have proven, business
in the 21st century is increasingly
more interdependent and more
challenging than ever before.
Starting a business might be easier,
but to survive entrepreneurs need
the tenacity to take an idea to
market, the business acumen to
turn a good plan into a proﬁtable
enterprise, and the ﬁnancial skill to
maintain success.

Business is a fascinating subject.
It surrounds us and affects us daily.
A walk down the street, a wander
around a supermarket, an Internet
search on almost any topic will
reveal commerce in its many and
varied forms. At its core business
is, and always has been, about
survival and surplus—about the
advancement of self and of society.
As the world continues to open
up, and as opportunities for
enterprise multiply, an interest
in business has never been more
relevant, or more exciting. Moreover,
for those with entrepreneurial
spirit, business has never been
more rewarding. ■

Continual change
For centuries social, political, and
technological factors have forced
companies and individuals to
create new ways of generating
proﬁts. Whether bartering goods
with a neighboring village or
seeking ways to make proﬁts from
social networking, business
thinking has changed, shifted, and
evolved to mirror the wants and
needs of the societies whose wealth
it creates. Sometimes, as in the
2008 ﬁnancial crisis, business failed
in its efforts. In other examples—the
legacy of Apple’s game-changing
products, for example—companies
have been spectacularly successful.

Business, more than any other
occupation, is a continual
dealing with the future; it
is a continual calculation,
an instinctive exercise
in foresight.

US magazine publisher (1898–1967)

A

ll businesses start from the
same point: an idea. It is
what happens to that idea
that determines business success.
According to Entrepreneur
magazine, nearly half of all new
start-ups fail within the ﬁrst three
years. Beating the odds at start-up
is tough. First and foremost an idea,
no matter how good, must be
combined with entrepreneurial
spirit, deﬁned as the willingness
to take risk. Without entrepreneurial
spirit a great idea might never be
pursued. Not all ideas are good
ones though; it would be a foolish
entrepreneur who rushed a product
to market without careful thought,
research, and detailed planning.
Risk might be inherent in business
enterprise, but successful
entrepreneurs are those who are
not only willing to take risks, but
are also able to manage risk.

Realistic propositions
Having an idea is the ﬁrst step—
the next hurdle is ﬁnance. Some
start-ups require very little capital,
and a few require none at all.
However, many require signiﬁcant
backing, and most will need to seek
funding at some stage in the
growth process. An entrepreneur
must be able to convince ﬁnancial
backers that the concept is valid

and that they have the skills and
knowledge to turn the original
concept into a successful business.
It follows that the idea must
be proﬁtable. Sometimes, an idea
may look great on paper, but turn
out to be uncommercial when put
into practice. Determining whether
an idea has potential requires a
study of the competition and the
relevant market. Who is competing
for customers’ time and money?
Are these competitors selling
directly competitive products or
possible substitutes? How are
competitors perceived in the
market? How big is the market?
Most markets are increasingly
global, crowded, and competitive.
Few companies are lucky enough to

The only thing worse
than starting something
and failing … is not
starting something.
Seth Godin
US entrepreneur (1960–)

ﬁnd a proﬁtable niche—to succeed,
companies need to do something
different in order to stand out in
the market. The strategy for most
companies is to differentiate; this
means demonstrating to customers
that they offer something that is not
available from competitors—a
Unique or Emotional Selling
Proposition (USP or ESP).
Such attempts to stand out are
everywhere. Every business, and
at every stage of production, from
raw-material extraction to aftersales service, tries to distinguish
its products or services from all
others. Walk into any bookstore,
for example, and you will see
countless examples of books, often
on the same topic, using design,
style, and even size (large or small)
to stand out from the competition.
Gaining an edge often depends
on one of two things: being ﬁrst
into a new market niche, or being
different from the competition. For
example, in 1995 eBay was ﬁrst
into the online auction market,
and has dominated it ever since.
Similarly, Volvo was ﬁrst to identify
the opportunity for luxury bus sales
in India, and has enjoyed healthy
sales. In contrast, Facebook was by
no means the ﬁrst social network,
but it is the most successful; its
edge was having a better product.

START SMALL, THINK BIG 19

Once a company is established,
the challenge shifts: the objective
now is to maintain sales and grow
in the short- and long-term.

Adapting to survive
Long-term business survival
depends upon the company
constantly reinventing and
adapting itself in order to remain
ahead of the competition. In
dynamic markets, which are
growing and evolving all the time,
the idea on which the company
was founded may become irrelevant
over time, and rivals will almost
certainly copy it. The ecosystem
in which a business operates is
rarely, if ever, static. Corporations
exist in these ecosystems as living
organisms that must adapt to
survive. In their 2013 book,
Reinventing Giants, Bill Fischer,
Umberto Lago, and Fang Liu noted
that the Chinese home appliances
company Haier had reinvented
itself at least three times in the
past 30 years. In contrast, Kodak,
a US giant of the 20th century, was
slow to react to the rise of digital
photography, and went bankrupt.
Moreover, just as the enterprise
must adapt, so too must the owner.
Most businesses start small, and
remain small. Few entrepreneurs
are willing or know how to take

the second step of employing
people who are neither family nor
previously known friends. This is
the start of a move from entrepreneur
to leader, and it requires a new set
of skills, as new demands are placed
on the business founders. Where
once energy, ideas, and passion
were enough, evolving businesses
require the development of formal
systems, procedures, and processes.
In short, they require management.
Founders must develop delegation,
communication, and coordination
skills, or they must employ people
who have them.
As Larry Greiner described in
his 1972 paper, “Evolution and
Revolution as Organizations Grow”,
as a business grows, the demands
on it change. The Greiner Curve is
a graphic that shows how the initial
stages of growth rely on individual
initiative, and that evolving ad-hoc
business practice into sustainable
and successful growth can only be
achieved by experienced people
and rigorous systems. Professional
management, as opposed to
entrepreneurial spirit, becomes
essential to business evolution.
Some leaders, such as Bill Gates
and Steve Jobs, for example, are
able to make the transition from
entrepreneurial founder to corporate
leader. Many others, however,

struggle to make the necessary
changes; some try and fail, while
others decide to remain small.

Finding a balance
Determining how fast to grow is,
therefore, a balance of the founder’s
skills and desires. But in order to
survive, the idea must be unique
enough to deﬁne its own niche, and
the individual or group behind it
must demonstrate entrepreneurial
spirit. They need the ﬂexibility to
adapt the idea—and themselves—
as business and market pressures
demand. Luck will play a part, but
it is the balance of these factors
that determines whether a small
start-up becomes a giant. ■

Younger entrepreneurs are

scenario. They may have gained
the necessary skills for business by
their early twenties, and enjoy the
excitement and freedom of running
their own venture.

Keeping the faith
While the reasons for start-up may
vary, what all entrepreneurs have in
common is the willingness to take
risks. Few entrepreneurs get it right
ﬁrst time—it takes resilience and
tenacity to keep going in the face
of failure, and it takes perseverance
to remain positive when customers,
banks, and ﬁnancial backers
repeatedly say “no.” Faith in the
idea is essential. While some startups require very little capital, most
require funding during their early
growth phases. A business owner
must be able to convince banks,
or other ﬁnancial backers, that their
concept is valid and that they have
the skills to turn the idea into a
proﬁtable venture, even though
this may take some time. It took
Amazon six years to make a proﬁt.

“Tony” Fernandes

In recent years, securing ﬁnance
for start-ups has become a little
easier. Many governments offer
loan plans or grants. Entrepreneurs
with big ideas can access large
funds of money and managerial
support from venture capitalists,
whose sole purpose is to incubate
start-ups. For smaller start-ups, and
for people with very little of their
own capital, micro-loans and
crowdfunding ﬁnance—such as
that offered by Kickstarter.com—
are increasingly popular.

Sustaining a business is
a hell of a lot of hard work,
and staying hungry is half
the battle.
Wendy Tan White
UK business executive (1970–)

The business plan
The key to securing ﬁnancing is
a business plan. A good plan will
outline the idea itself, detail any
supporting market research,
describe operational and marketing
activities, and give ﬁnancial
predictions. The plan should also
outline a strategy for long-term
growth and identify contingencies
(alternative ideas or markets) if
things do not go as planned.
Most importantly, a good
business plan will acknowledge
that the biggest reason for business

failure is a lack of cash. While
loan capital can help for a while,
eventually a business must fund
its operations from revenue. A good
business plan will analyze future
cash ﬂows and identify any
potential shortfalls.
Beating the odds at start-up is
deﬁned by the tenacity to take an
idea to market, the ability to secure
sufﬁcient ﬁnance, and the business
acumen to turn a good plan into a
long-term, proﬁtable enterprise. ■

THERE’S A GAP IN
THE MARKET, BUT
IS THERE A MARKET
IN
THE
GAP?
FINDING A PROFITABLE NICHE
IN CONTEXT
FOCUS
Positioning strategy

Many markets are crowded,
with multiple sellers chasing
the same customers.

KEY DATES
1950s and 60s Markets are
dominated by large companies
offering mass-produced items,
such as Coca-Cola. Choice is
limited, but the scope for
products targeted at new
sectors of the market is high.

For these sellers, competition
lowers proﬁtability.

1970s and 80s Markets
become more segmented as
companys generate new
products and market them
toward narrower groups.

Market gaps—a new product or
sector of the market—offer the
enticing prospect of healthy
proﬁtability.

1990s and 2000s Companies
and brands position themselves
ever-more aggressively and
distinctively in the
overcrowded marketplace.
2010s Finding and sustaining
market niches is assisted by
the promotional capabilities
of the Internet, which allow
“one-to-one” marketing and
customization of products.

But does the gap contain
enough business
to generate a proﬁt?

There’s a gap in the
market, but is there a
market in the gap?

F

inding a space in the
market that is unchallenged
by competition is the Holy
Grail of positioning strategy.
Unfortunately these spaces—
known as market gaps—are often
illusive, and the beneﬁts of ﬁnding
one are often equally illusory.
Although competition is a fact of
life, it makes business difﬁcult,
contributing to an ever-downward
pressure on prices, ever-rising costs
(such as the funding of new product
development and marketing), and an
incessant need to outmaneuver and
outsmart rivals. In contrast, the
beneﬁts of ﬁnding a market gap—a
small niche segment of a market that
is unfettered by competition—are
obvious: greater control over prices,
lower costs, and improved proﬁts.
The identiﬁcation of a market
gap, combined with a dose of
entrepreneurial spirit, is often all
that is needed to launch a new
business. In 2006, Twitter founder
Jack Dorsey combined short-form
communication with social media,
providing a service that no one else
had spotted. Free to most users,
revenue comes from companies who
pay for promotional tweets and
proﬁles: Twitter earned advertising
revenues of $582 million in 2013.

Not all gaps are lucrative, however.
The Amphicar, for instance, was an
amphibious car produced in the
1960s for US consumers who wanted
to drive on roads and rivers. It was a
quirky novelty, but the market was
too small to be proﬁtable. This was
also true for bottled water for pets—
launched in the US in 1994, Thirsty
Cat! and Thirsty Dog! failed to
entice pet owners.

Snapple’s positioning in the
crowded US beverage marketplace
was the key to its success. By
focusing on a niche healthy product
and marketing itself as a quirky

small, inner-city stores where
customers could “grab-and-go.”
These tactics helped to secure a
proﬁtable and sustainable niche,
distinguishing Snapple from its
rivals in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1994
sales peaked at $674 million.
Unoccupied market territory can
present major opportunities for
companies, but the challenge lies in
identifying which gaps are proﬁtable
and which are traps. During the
1990s, many companies became
excited about the potential of the
“green” market, across a whole range
of goods. But this market has failed
to materialize in any proﬁtable way.
This marks one of the potential
pitfalls in identifying market gaps
based on market research:
sometimes consumers have strong
attitudes or opinions on trends or
issues—such as ecology—that they
are disinclined to consider when
purchasing products, especially if
they affect cost. Many market gaps,
it seems, are tempting, but illusory. ■

courses. It is a creative tool that
allows managers to assess a
company’s current position, and to
imagine possible future positions.

SWOT analysis

A practical tool

The most popular such tool is
SWOT analysis. Created by US
management consultant Albert
Humphrey in 1966, it is used to
identify internal strengths (S) and
weaknesses (W), and to analyze
external opportunities (O) and
threats (T). Internal factors that can
be considered as either strengths or
weaknesses include: the experience
and expertise of management; the
skill of a work force; product quality;
the company’s ﬁnancial health; and
the strength of its brand. External
factors that might be opportunities
or threats include market growth;
new technologies; barriers to
entering markets; overseas sales
potential; and changing customer
demographics and preferences.
SWOT analysis is widely used
by businesses of all types, and it is
a staple of business management

When well-executed, a SWOT
analysis should inform strategic
planning and decision-making. It
allows a company to identify what
it does better than rivals (or vice
versa), what changes it may need to
make to minimize threats, and what
opportunities may give the company
competitive advantage. The key to
strategic ﬁt is to make sure that the
company’s internal and external
environments match: its internal
strengths must be aligned with the
external opportunities. Any internal
weaknesses should be addressed
so as to minimize the extent of
external threat.
When undertaking a SWOT
analysis, the views of staff and
even customers can be included—
it should provide an opportunity to
solicit views from all stakeholders.
The greater the number of views

included, the deeper the analysis
and the more useful the ﬁndings.
However, there are limitations. While
a company may be able to judge its
internal weaknesses and strengths
accurately, projections about future
events and trends (which will affect
opportunities and threats) are
always subject to error. Different
stakeholders will also be privy to
different levels of information about
a company’s activities, and therefore
its current position. Balance is key; ❯❯

26 STUDY THE COMPETITION
senior managers may have a full
view of the company, but their
perspective needs to be informed
by alternative views from all levels
of the organization.
As with all business tools, the
factor that governs the success of
SWOT analysis is whether or not
it leads to action. Even the most
comprehensive analysis is useless
unless its ﬁndings are translated
into well-conceived plans, new
processes, and better performance.

Market mapping
A slightly narrower but more
sophisticated tool for analyzing a
company’s position and competition

is “market mapping” (also known as
“perceptual mapping”). Market maps
are diagrams that represent a market
and the placement of products within
that market, providing a visual
means of studying the competition.
The process is useful both internally
(to help an organization understand
its own products) and externally (to
chart how consumers perceive the
brand in relation to the competition).
To draw up a market map, a
company identiﬁes several consumer
purchase-decision factors that
stand in opposition to one another.
In the fashion market, an example
might include “technology” vs.
“fashion,” and “performance” vs.

Market mapping plots opposing qualities of products
along two axes. By identifying the two main oppositional
factors for any product, it is easy to see gaps in the market.
PERFORMANCE

“leisure.” Additional factors could
include the item’s price (high vs.
low), quality of production (high
vs. low), stylish vs. conservative,
or durable vs. disposable. Two of
these dimensions, or opposing
pairs, are then plotted onto a
horizontal or vertical axis.
Based on market research or the
knowledge of managers, all of the
products within a particular market
can be plotted onto the map. The
market share of each product can
be represented by the size of its
corresponding image on the map,
but more often, analysts choose to
simply make a rough sketch of the
market, ignoring market size.
A company may choose to
compile several market maps, each
of which depicts a different set of
variables, and then analyze them—
individually and in combination—
to gain an overall view of the
company’s position in the market.

LEISURE

The goal of market mapping is
to identify opportunities where a
company can differentiate itself
from its competitors. These are
areas where the company offers
unique value, and they can be used
to inform marketing messages. The
map will also reveal overcrowded
segments, which signify
heightened competitive threat.
For a new start-up, a market
map can be used to identify a
viable gap in the market—a good
place to position a company when
it is struggling to establish itself.
Established businesses can use
market mapping combined with
SWOT analysis to discover
opportunities and decide whether
the company has the strengths to
exploit one of those opportunities.
The market map helps to inform
the strategy (the need to reposition
a product away from competitors’

offerings, for example) and the
tactics (moving from conservative
to sporty, for example) that will
help the company to achieve
that strategic goal.
Market analysis such as this may,
for example, have helped luxury
Singaporean tea shop TWG Tea
to identify an opportunity in the
market. Launched in 2008, TWG
targets a slightly older, wealthier
customer base than coffee shops
and other “lifestyle” cafés. TWG
has opened new locations across
the world, based on studying the
competition, identifying a market
gap, and designing its products
and services to ﬁll that gap.

Internal focus
As a company grows it might
choose to draw up a map including
just its own products. Analysis of
the results can help identify any
overlap between different products
(informing decisions about which
products to drop, and which to
concentrate research and
development and marketing spend,
for example). It can also be used
to ensure that the company’s
marketing message stays on track,
helping to avoid strategic drift.

Perceived as a technical
performance product, Speedo,
for example, needs to ensure that
its marketing reﬂects that view;
a campaign that promotes Speedo
as a fashionable label would risk
confusing customers and could
damage the brand.
The key to successful market
mapping is market research. While
it can be useful to compare internal
and external perceptions of a
product, and the products of the
competition, it is the customers’
views that matter most. When

managers may disagree, the market
map cannot be “wrong”—it simply

how the brand is perceived. The
challenge for management is to use
the map, and knowledge of internal
strengths and weaknesses, to plan
the appropriate strategic response.
Both SWOT analysis and market
mapping allow a company to better
understand itself, its market, and,
most importantly, the competition.
Equally, being aware of weaknesses
can help avoid costly strategic
mistakes, such as producing overly
ambitious products or making an
entry into a crowded market
position. An appreciation of the
opportunities and threats of the

customers something that the
competition cannot or does not
offer—a Unique Selling Proposition
(USP). The concept was developed
by US advertising executive Rosser
Reeves in the 1940s to represent
the key point of dramatic difference
that makes a product salable at a
price higher than rival products.
Tangible USPs are hard to acquire
and hard to copy, which is what
makes them unique.
Companies must distinguish
their product or service from the
competition at every stage of
production—from raw material
extraction to after-sales service.
Products such as Nespresso coffeemakers and Crocs footwear, and
service providers such as majority
Asian-owned hotel group Tune
Hotels, are all heavily differentiated,
each having a strong USP.
The primary beneﬁt of
uniqueness, however it is achieved,
is greater customer loyalty and
increased ﬂexibility in pricing.
Differentiation guards products
and services from low-priced
competition; it justiﬁes higher

prices and protects proﬁtability;
and it can give businesses the
competitive advantage needed
to stand out in the market.

The challenge of difference
By deﬁnition, not all products can
be unique. Differentiation is costly,
time consuming, and difﬁcult to
achieve, and functional differences
are quickly copied—“me-too”
strategies are commonplace.
Touchscreen technology was
introduced to the cell-phone market
as a point of differentiation for
Apple’s iPhone, but is now a feature
of most smartphones.
Differentiation often does not
remain a point of difference for long.
With functional uniqueness
being so elusive, marketing guru
Philip Kotler suggested that
companies focus instead on an
Emotional Selling Proposition (ESP).
In other words, that the task of
marketing is to generate an
emotional connection to the brand
that is so strong that customers
perceive difference from the
competition. For example, while

the design and functionality of Nike
and Adidas sneakers are distinct,
the differences are so small that
they amount to only a marginal
difference in performance. The
products’ differences are, however,
magniﬁed in the perception of the
consumer through marketing and
the power of branding—uniqueness
is achieved through brand imagery,
promotion, and sponsorship.

distinctive look quickly caught the

eye of celebrities (a jacket worn
by soccer player David Beckham
became one of its best-selling
products, and Beckham himself
became an unofﬁcal talisman of the
brand), providing free publicity.
Superdry focused on offering
clothing with a fashionably tailored
ﬁt and attention to detail (even down
to garment stitching). Worn by offduty ofﬁce workers, students, sports
stars, and celebrities alike, the
brand was able to appeal to a broad
customer base. Most differentiation
strategies involve targeting one
segment of the market; Superdry
chose to target them all. The brand’s
unique blend of fashion with ease of
wear, comfort with style, and the
presence of mysterious but
meaningless Japanese writing,
has proved a difﬁcult mix for
competitors to replicate.

Maintaining uniqueness
As many companies discover,
popularity can be the enemy of
difference. While Superdry clothing
has become increasingly
ubiquitous around the world, its
uniqueness and difference have
declined. The challenge for
Superdry, like all companies, is to
protect its uniqueness while also

expanding its reach—to stand out
from the crowd, while welcoming
those crowds into its stores.
Differentiation can occur at any
point in the value chain. Standing
out is not limited to products or
services—it can occur in any
number of internal processes
that translate into an improved
customer experience. Swedish
furniture retailer IKEA, for
example, differentiates itself not
only through contemporary design
and low prices, but through the
entire customer retail experience.
The company’s low prices are
achieved, in part, through its selfpicking and self-assembly retail
model—the customer experience
involves picking products from the
company’s vast showrooms and
warehouses and then, once they
have transported the goods home,
assembling the furniture.
Even the way IKEA “guides”
shoppers on a one-way, deﬁned
route through its showrooms is
unique. While this tactic encourages
spontaneous purchases, it also
helps to reinforce IKEA’s points of
difference—customers are exposed
to predesigned rooms and
furniture layouts that emphasize
the brand’s contemporary style.
Price is kept low since fewer store
assistants are required to direct
customers around the store.

Different but the same
Paradoxically, familiarity can also
be a source of differentiation. The
entire McDonald’s organization
revolves around providing almost
identical fast-food products, with
the same service, in identical
Fashion label Superdry is a young

In a market in which rival

have become increasingly savvy
when it comes to distinguishing

differences do not have to be

Sustaining differentiation
Once established, uniqueness—
whether functional or emotional—
requires nurturing and protecting.
Standing out from the crowd is a
constant battle that is fought in the
hearts and minds of the company’s
staff, as well as customers. As legal
clashes between rivals—such as
Apple and Samsung—demonstrate,
uniqueness might also have to be
contested in the courtroom.
Every industry has leaders and
followers—what separates them is
that the leaders are usually those
with the most defensible points of
differentiation. Whether in features
and functionality, brand image,
service, process, speed, or
convenience, uniqueness must be
established and communicated for
a company and its offerings to stand
out in the market. The key to longlasting success is making that
differentiation sustainable. ■

Rosser Reeves (1910–84)

After a brief spell at the
University of Virginia, from
where he was expelled for
drunken misconduct, Reeves
worked as a journalist and
then copywriter before joining
advertising agency Ted Bates,
Inc. in New York in 1940. His
exceptional talent saw him rise
to become Chairman of the
company in 1955. He is credited
with redeﬁning television
advertising and, among many
others, for formulating slogans
such as “It melts in your

outlined in the 1940s, was
described in his 1961 book
Reality of Advertising. Such

1988 by Stanford Business School
professor David Montgomery and
his co-author, Marvin Lieberman.

Amazon.com was a ﬁrst-mover
in the online retail market. It has
dominated the industry since its
launch in 1995, creating strong brand
recognition and a loyal customer base.

on by the example of Amazon,
businesses spent millions pitching
themselves headlong into new
online markets. Conventional
wisdom was that being ﬁrst
ensured that the company’s brand
name became synonymous with
that segment, and that early market
dominance would create barriers to
entry for subsequent competition.
In the end, however,
overspending, overhype, and
overreaching into markets where
little demand existed was the
downfall of many ﬂedgling dot-coms.
With notable exceptions, businesses
found that promised returns were
not being realized and funds quickly
ran short—and for many of these
ﬁrst-movers, failure followed.

First-mover advantage
Being ﬁrst out of the block
undoubtedly has its advantages,
and in the case of the dot-coms,
those advantages were exaggerated
to the extreme. First-movers often
enjoy premium prices, capture
signiﬁcant market share, and have

a brand name strongly linked to
the market itself. First-movers also
have more time than later entrants
to perfect processes and systems,
and to accumulate market
knowledge. They can also secure
advantageous physical locations
(a prime location on a main street
of a city, for example), secure the
employment of talented staff, or

access beneﬁcial terms with key
suppliers (who may also be eager to
enter the new market). Additionally,
ﬁrst-movers may be able to build
switching costs into their product,
making it expensive or inconvenient
for customers to switch to a rival
offering once an initial purchase
has been made. Gillette, for example,
having invented the safety razor in
1901, has consistently leveraged its
ﬁrst-mover advantage to create new
products, such as a “shaving system”
that combines cheap handles with
expensive razor blades.

Market strategies
In the case of Amazon.com, ﬁrstmover advantage consisted of a
combination of factors. In the newly
emerging e-commerce market,
customers were eager to try online
purchasing, and Amazon was well
placed to exploit this growing
curiosity. Books represented a small
and safe initial purchase, and
Amazon’s simple web design made
buying easy and enjoyable. Early
sales enabled the organization to
adapt and perfect its systems,
and to adjust its website to match
customer needs—adding, for
example, its OneClick ordering
system to enable purchases
without entering payment details.
Amazon was also able to build
distribution systems that ensured
quick and reliable delivery of its
products. Although competitors
could replicate these systems,

the organization enjoyed created
signiﬁcant emotional switching
costs; even today, Amazon enjoys
the beneﬁts of this trust and loyalty,
and almost a third of all US book
sales are made via Amazon.com.
A recent example of how
important ﬁrst-mover advantage
remains are the “patent wars”
contested between most of the
leading smartphone makers
(including Apple, Samsung, and
HTC). Patents help a company to
defend technological advantage. In
the hypercompetitive smartphone
industry, being ﬁrst to market with
a new technological feature offers
critical, albeit short-term, advantage.
In an industry in which consumers’
switching costs are high, even
short-term advantages can have
a signiﬁcant impact on revenue.
Since the publication of
Montgomery and Lieberman’s
original paper in 1988, academic

research has indicated that
signiﬁcant advantages accrue
to market pioneers, which can be
directly attributable to the timing
of entry. The irony is that in a
retrospective paper that appeared
in 1998, “First-Mover (Dis)
Advantages,” Montgomery and
Lieberman themselves backed off
their original claims concerning
the beneﬁts of being the ﬁrst to
enter a market.
Building on the work of, among
others, US academics Peter Golder
and Gerard Tellis in 1993,
Montgomery and Lieberman’s 1998
paper questioned the entire notion
of ﬁrst-mover advantage. In their
research, Golder and Tellis had
found that almost half the ﬁrstmovers in their sample of 500
brands, in 50 product categories,
failed. Moreover, they found that
there were few cases where later
entrants had not become proﬁtable
or even dominant players—in fact,
their research identiﬁed that the
failure rate for ﬁrst-movers was
47 percent, compared to only
8 percent for fast followers.

Learning from mistakes
The challenge for ﬁrst-movers is
that the market is often unproven;
industry pioneers leap into the
dark without fully understanding
customer needs or market
dynamics. First-movers often
launch untried products onto
unsuspecting customers; and it is
rare that they get it right ﬁrst time.
Large companies may be able to
take the losses of such early-market
entry mistakes; small companies,
on the other hand, may soon ﬁnd
that their cash is running out and
their tenuous business models
are collapsing.
Later entrants have the
advantage of learning from the
mistakes of the ﬁrst-movers, and

from entering a proven market.
They are also able to avoid costly
investment in risky and potentially
ﬂawed processes or technologies;
ﬁrst-movers, by contrast, may have
accrued signiﬁcant “sunk costs”
(past investment) in old, lessefﬁcient technologies, and may be
less able to adapt as the industry
matures. Followers can enter at
the point at which technology
and processes are relatively well
established, with both cost and
risks being lower.
Followers may have to ﬁght
to overcome the ﬁrst-movers’
brand loyalty, but simply offering
a superior product that better
addresses customer needs is
often sufﬁcient to secure a market.
Brand recognition is one thing,
but technical and product superiority
can give that all-important
competitive edge. Moreover, with
investment costs being much
lower, followers often have surplus
cash to use on marketing, thereby
offsetting the branding advantages
of the ﬁrst-mover.
When Google, for example,
entered the Internet search
business in 1998, the market was
dominated by the likes of Yahoo,
Lycos, and AltaVista, all of whom
had established customer bases
and brand recognition. However,
Google was able to learn from the

mistakes of these earlier entrants
and, quite simply, build a better
product. The organization realized
that with so much information on
the Internet people wanted search
results that were comprehensive
and relevant; the various market
incumbents offered a variety of
systems for ﬁltering search results,
but Google was able to take the
best of these systems and build
its own unique algorithm that led
to market dominance.

Us.) The online clothing retailer
boo.com is an example of a ﬁrstmover that had technological
superiority, but was ahead of its
time—the site was too resourceheavy for most consumers’ slow
Internet connections. Launched in
1999, boo.com went into receivership
the following year—being ﬁrst is
not a guarantee of success if the
basic business model is ﬂawed.
Despite the evidence presented
by Golder and Tellis, and examples
such as Google, it remains the case
that ﬁrst-mover advantage has
captured corporate imagination.
Mirroring the earlier dot-com gold
rush, the recent boom in the market
for web-based smartphone- and
tablet-accessed applications (the
“app” market) is fueled by a desire
to be ﬁrst. Thousands of apps have
launched in the hope of staking
their claims on lucrative segments

Timing is everything
The reason a ﬁrst-mover does
not always yield its promised
advantages is that much depends
on timing, and therefore luck. In
their 2005 paper, “The Half-Truth
of First-Mover Advantage,” US
business scholars Fernando Suarez
and Gianvito Lanzolla identiﬁed
technological innovation and the
speed at which the market is
developing as crucial in
determining whether or not being
a ﬁrst-mover is advantageous.

There are numerous examples in
corporate history of ﬁrst-movers

Famous failures in the online
sphere include Friends Reunited

companies still exist, their ﬁrstmover advantage was not sufﬁcient
to offset the might (and product
superiority) of Facebook. Similarly,
eToys.com, launched in 1999, was

signiﬁcant. They give the example
of the market for vacuum cleaners,
and, in particular, of the long-term
market leader, Hoover. Until the
relatively recent introduction of
Dyson cleaners, the market was
benign and technological
advancement slow. Having been
ﬁrst to market in 1908, Hoover
enjoyed several decades of
advantage—an advantage that
was (and, in some places, still is)
reﬂected in the widespread use of
the company’s brand name as the
verb “to hoover.”
In other industries, however,
where technological change or
market evolution is rapid, ﬁrstmovers are often at a disadvantage.
The ﬁrst search engines are
examples of businesses that had
too much invested in early
iterations of a technology to keep
up with the rapid pace of change.
Early advantage quickly
becomes obsolete in changeable
markets. As the market evolves,
later entrants are those that seem
to be cutting edge, offering
innovative features that build on
the market-knowledge as well as
learning from the mistakes of the
ﬁrst-mover. The ﬁrst-mover may

have enjoyed short-lived advantage
but in dynamic markets such an
advantage is rarely durable. Even
Apple, who enjoyed signiﬁcant
early-entrant advantage in the
smartphone market with the
iPhone, is not immune from ﬁrstmover disadvantage. Competitors,
Samsung in particular, were able
to listen to customer complaints
about iPhones, analyze customer
needs, and produce products with
features and functionality welcomed
by the market. Apple, locked into
previous technology iterations, took
time to react and iPhone sales
suffered as a result.

Customer needs
To gain an edge, therefore, you do
not always need to be ﬁrst. Indeed,
US multinational Procter & Gamble,
for example, prefers only to enter
those markets in which it can
establish a strong number one or
number two position over the longterm—rarely is this achieved in a
blind rush to be ﬁrst.
Procter & Gamble seeks
markets that are demographically
and structurally attractive, with
lower capital requirements, and
higher margins. But most

importantly, the organization
insists on a deep understanding of
customer needs in any market they
enter. In other words, they would
rather enter mature markets than
be ﬁrst into new ones.
The company values long-term
relationships with its customers
and suppliers; its view of innovation
is different from small companies
who, in attempting to capture
market share, strive to gain an
edge through the introduction of
disruptive technology—innovative
technology that seeks to destabilize
the existing market. Procter &
Gamble, perhaps heeding the
research, considers such strategies
to be short-lived. They realize that
overly rapid innovation runs the risk
of cannibalizing their own sales
and reducing the returns on new
product investment. In the market
for disposable baby diapers, for
example, Procter & Gamble was
more than ten years behind the ﬁrst
mover. The company’s now famous
Pampers brand was launched in
1961, following some way behind
Johnson & Johnson’s Chux brand,
The PalmPilot, launched in 1997, was
a successful fast-follower product. It
followed Apple’s unsuccessful Newton,
which was the ﬁrst personal digital
assistant (PDA) to enter the market.

START SMALL, THINK BIG 39
which was launched in 1949. At
the time, disposable diapers were
a new innovation, and customers
were wary of their use. Procter &
Gamble waited until customers had
come to accept the product before
entering the market. Moreover, they
spent nearly ﬁve years researching
and addressing each of the major
problems with Chux and developed
a product that was more absorbent,
had lower leakage, was more
comfortable for the baby, offered
two sizes, and could be produced
at a signiﬁcantly lower cost. Today,
Forbes magazine lists Pampers as
one of the world’s most powerful
brands, valued at over $8.5 billion,
with the diapers being purchased
by 25 million consumers in over 100
countries. By contrast, Chux was
phased out by Johnson & Johnson
in the 1970s due to shrinking sales.

Securing a foothold
In reality, then, while it is readily
assumed that speed is good when
entering a market, gaining an edge
might depend less on timing than it
does on appropriateness. Whether a
company is ﬁrst, second, or last to
market is important; but it is less
important than the suitability of a

Jeff Bezos

company’s products or services to
that market, and its ability to
deliver on brand promises. Both
these factors can have a profound
impact on long-term viability and
business success.
Amazon may have enjoyed
lasting ﬁrst-mover advantage, but
that alone is insufﬁcient to account
for its phenomenal success. Amazon
leverages its ﬁrst-mover advantage
into a sustainable competitive edge;
its website is continually made
easier to use, it offers a range of
complimentary products, and it
continues to drive down costs,
enabling it to offer market-beating
prices. Most notably, Amazon did
not return a proﬁt until 2001—the
company spent its earlier years
building a better product. The
foundations of success may have
been laid by ﬁrst-mover advantage,
but Amazon’s edge has been built on
long-term good business practice.
First-movers undoubtedly have a
natural competitive edge. Whether
it is a lasting impression on
customers, strong brand recognition,
high switching costs, control of
scarce resources, or the advantages
of experience, that edge can help
to secure a strong, and long-term,

foothold in the market. But as
research shows, second-movers,
and their followers, may sometimes
be in an advantageous position.
Learning from the mistakes of early
entrants, they frequently offer
superior products at lower prices.
With the aid of skillful marketing,
these beneﬁts can be leveraged to
offset the advantages enjoyed by
ﬁrst-movers. To become a market
leader, a business needs either to
be ﬁrst, and impressive, or it needs
to be better. The companies we
remember, the Amazons and the
Googles, are those that were either
ﬁrst or better—the ones we forget
are those that had no edge at all. ■

Born on January 12, 1964 in
Albuquerque, New Mexico, US,
Jeff Bezos had an early love of
science and computers. He
studied computer science and
electrical engineering at Princeton
University, and graduated summa
cum laude in 1986.
Bezos started his career on
Wall Street, and by 1990 had
become the youngest senior
vice-president at the investment
company D. E. Shaw. Four years
later, in 1994, he quit his lucrative
job to open Amazon.com, the
online book retailer—he was
barely 30 years old at the time.

As with many Internet startups, Bezos, with just a handful
of employees, created the new
business in his garage; but as
operations grew, they moved
into a small house. The Amazon.
com site was launched ofﬁcially
on July 16, 1995. Amazon
became a public limited
company in 1997; the company’s
ﬁrst year of proﬁt was 2001.
Today, Bezos is listed by Forbes
magazine as one of the wealthiest
people in the US; and Amazon
stands as one of the biggest
global success stories in the
history of the Internet.

risk—particularly the risk of
business failure. This is especially
true for those starting new

From the collapse of Lehman
Brothers (2008), to BP’s Deepwater
Horizon disaster (2010), events of
the early 21st century fundamentally
changed how organizations
perceive risk. Companies now think
in terms of two factors: oversight
and management. “Risk oversight”
is how a company’s owners govern
the processes for identifying,
prioritizing, and managing critical
risks, and for ensuring that these
processes are continually reviewed.
“Risk management” refers to the
detailed procedures and policies
for avoiding or reducing risks.

Inherent risks
Risk is inherent in all business
activity. Start-ups, for example, face
the risk of too few customers, and
therefore insufﬁcient revenue to
cover costs. There is also the risk
that a competitor will copy the
company’s idea, and perhaps offer a
better alternative. When a company
has borrowed money from a bank

there is a risk that interest rates will
rise, and repayments will become
too burdensome to afford. Start-ups
that rely on overseas trade are also
exposed to exchange-rate risk.
Moreover, new businesses in
particular may be exposed to the
risk of operating in only one market.
Whereas large companies often
diversify their operations to spread
risk, the success of small companies
is often linked to the success of one
idea (the original genesis for the

such as the local area. A decline
in that market or area can lead
to failure. It is essential that new
businesses are mindful of market
changes, and position themselves
to adapt to those changes.
The Instagram image-sharing
social-media application, for example,
started life as a location-based
service called Burbn. Faced with
competition, the business changed

Instagram not reacted to the risks,
and been savvy enough to diversify
its offering (regularly adding new

Emil Gumbel

At its heart, risk is a strategic
issue. Business owners must
carefully weigh the operational risk
of start-up, or the risks of a new
product or new project, against
potential proﬁts or losses—in other
words, the strategic consequences
of action vs. inaction. Risk must be
quantiﬁed and managed; and it
poses a constant strategic challenge.
Fortune favors the brave, but with
people’s lives and the success of the
business at stake, caution cannot
simply be thrown to the wind. ■

In deep water

BP’s Deepwater Horizon incident
led to huge ﬁnes and US government
monitoring of its safety practices and
ethics for four years.

Even large and diverse
organizations can ﬁnd it hard to
successfully balance risk against
potential ﬁnancial reward. On
April 20, 2010, Deepwater Horizon,
an offshore oil rig chartered by
British Petroleum (BP), exploded,
killing 11 workers and spilling
tens of thousands of barrels of
crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico.
The incident was blamed on
management failure to adequately
quantify and manage risk; the
ofﬁcial hearing cited a culture
of “every dollar counts.” Analysts

who examined the disaster
claimed that BP had prioritized
ﬁnancial return over operational
risk. Chief executive Tony
Hayward, who took the post
in 2007, had suggested that the
organization’s poor performance
at the time was due to excessive
caution. Coupled with
increasing pressure from
shareholders for better returns,
the bullish approach that
followed led to signiﬁcant cost
cutting and, eventually, riskmanagement failures.

Yet, as McDonald’s CEO Ray Kroc
said, “the more you sweat, the
luckier you get,” suggesting that luck
can be created. The reality is that
both are true. As global markets
become more volatile and less
predictable, luck plays an inevitable
part in business success. Launch a
start-up at the same time as a rival
and it may be luck that determines
who succeeds, and who fails.

The ﬁrst rule of luck in
business is that you should
persevere in doing the right
thing. Opportunities will
come your way if you do.
Ronald Cohen

Making your own luck
A well-considered business plan is
designed to dispense with reliance
on luck. A good idea, underpinned
by detailed market research and
solid ﬁnancial planning, may help
a start-up to ride the whims of the
market. A good plan charts a course
of action in turbulent markets,
protects against the unknown,
and prepares the company
for contingencies.
In addition, a well-conceived plan
can ensure that a company is in a
position to beneﬁt from favorable

market conditions. In other words,
what might seem like luck is often
the result of planning. Take the
famous example of 3M Post-it Notes.
The invention of a reusable glue was
accidental, but it was business
insight that turned the lucky
discovery into a commercial success.
With so many variables, luck is
likely to play a part in the survival of
a start-up. But a good plan reduces
how much luck a company needs. ■

T

reality is that small businesses
outnumber large companies by a
signiﬁcant margin. In fact, most
businesses never grow beyond the

99 percent of companies employ
fewer than 500 people. In 2012,
there were almost 5 million small

employees), but only 6,000 companies
employing more than 250 people.
Aspiration, or its lack, is a key
factor for small-scale companies.
Many small-business owners are
content with the lifestyle the

no desire for growth. But he biggest
reason for a lack of growth is ﬁnance.
Growth requires access to capital,
which is difﬁcult and expensive
to access for small companies.
Moreover, unlimited liability means
that an owner’s personal assets
(such as the family home) are at
risk if the business fails—a risk
that many are unwilling to take.

Entrepreneurial spirit is deﬁned
as the willingness to take risks.
Business owners who do aspire to
growth must be willing to take the
risky but important second step.
For most small-business owners,
this means employing the ﬁrst

and management skills to scale the
business and manage the people,
systems, and processes. ■

as the self-ﬁnanceable growth
rate (SFG), it helps managers to
strike the right balance between
consuming and generating cash.
It does this by measuring three
things: the amount of time a
company’s money is tied up in
inventory before the company has
paid for its goods or services; the
amount of money needed to ﬁnance
each dollar of sales; and the amount
of cash that is generated by each
dollar of sales.

Sustainable growth
When accurately applied, the
SFG formula determines the rate
at which a company can sustain
growth through only the revenues
it generates—without needing to
approach external funding agencies
for more cash. Essentially, it
predicts a sustainable growth rate
and helps to avoid overtrading.
When a market is growing faster

for managers to exploit the growth
opportunity: speed up cash ﬂow;
reduce costs; or raise prices.

Each of these “levers” helps to
generate the cash needed to fuel

professional managers who bring
to the business an understanding
of the requirements of ﬁnancial
markets, banks, and—most
importantly—have the leadership
skills needed to manage complex
organizations. Entrepreneurs may
possess bountiful ideas, but it takes
management discipline to turn
those ideas into successful

ventures, and leadership skills
to move the start-up beyond its
entrepreneurial roots.
Start-ups require the spark
of entrepreneurship; but growth
requires a different set of skills: a
founder must transition from being
sole decision maker to being a
disciplined manager and a
successful leader. Those who are
unable to make this transition
often need to step aside and let the
professionals take over. But this is
often easier said than done. ■

Middle management
The importance of middle
management was described by

explains the self-regulating forces
of the market. Chandler noted that
before 1850, family ﬁrms dominated
business in the USA. These ﬁrms
had poor communication networks
and limited access to educated
staff, so rarely grew beyond groups
of family and friends who could be
educated, trained, and trusted to
manage the business.

transportation and communication
allowed ﬁrms to grow beyond the
immediate gaze of friends or family,
and beyond the immediate locale.
But to prosper in this new
environment, companies needed
more rigorous processes and
structures. The increasing
geographic scope and size of
businesses required new levels of
coordination and communication.
Businesses had grown too unwieldy
for one person to manage; they
required the oversight of a team of
people. This marked the emergence
and rise of the professional manager.

As standardization and mass
production emerged in the early 20th
century, the role of management
grew. Business was taking place on
an increasingly global scale. Even
before mechanization, coordination
from managers enabled mass
production. Standardization turned
management into a science, and
managers into a vital cog in the
organizational machine.

Enablers and enterprise
In a 2007 Harvard Business Review
article “The Process Audit,” US
businessman Michael Hammer ❯❯

50 KEEP EVOLVING BUSINESS PRACTICE
summarized the science of
management (which is essentially
the management of business
process) into two factors: enablers
and enterprise capabilities.
Enterprise capabilities stem from
senior management, and include
culture, tight governance
mechanisms, and strategic vision.
Enablers, however, are the task of
middle management. They include
design, infrastructure, process,
protocol, responsibilities, and
performance management. The
enablers turn vision into reality.

Realizing the vision
Hammer claimed that while the
aspiration for business growth
might come out of the boardroom,
it is a company’s infrastructure—
designed and implemented by
middle management—that makes
growth possible. Vision without
infrastructure is just a dream—it
cannot become a reality. Leaders
of growing companies know that,
regardless of their own aspirations,
the building blocks of growth are
laid by middle management.
At the Japanese brewer Asahi,
for example, it was a team of
middle managers who developed
Super Dry Beer, starting a craze in

Cath Kidston

Japan for dry beer and allowing the
company to capture more market
share. Similarly, a group of Motorola
middle managers was lauded for
successfully developing a new
wireless digital system for a client
in under one year (the process
usually takes two to three years).
Sitting between senior leaders
and operational staff, middle
managers are the communications
conduit through which executives
remain attuned to day-to-day
business and personnel issues.
Middle managers, as the Asahi and
Motorola examples show, are often
at the heart of corporate inspiration
and perspiration—they generate
ideas and they work to realize ideas
in practice. Middle management
is also the driver of functional
efﬁciency: improvements in cost,
quality, speed, and reliability are
delivered by middle management
and the processes it introduces.

Middle management as
a technology enables the
organization as we know it.
Alfred Chandler
US business historian (1918–2007)

As a business evolves, so must the
management processes that enable
it. Whereas initial stages of growth
rely on individual initiative and
entrepreneurial spirit, evolving
ad-hoc practices into sustainable
growth needs to be based on

lessons learned through business
experience. The true science of
management is the conversion of
experience into repeatable and
reliable process—today’s problems
become tomorrow’s processes and
next year’s capabilities.
Process is the “stuff” of
management. Business processes
are essential to maintaining order;
like a country’s rail system and the
rules that accompany it, processes
are the infrastructure around which
a company organizes. Business
practice must evolve as the business
grows from a single outlet to a chain,
from one staff member to many,
and from national to multinational.

English fashion designer, author,
and entrepreneur Catherine
Kidston was born in 1958. Raised
with her three siblings near
Andover in Hampshire, she was
educated at a number of English
boarding schools, before moving
to London at 18.
After working as a store
assistant, she ran a vintage curtain
business with a friend on London’s
King’s Road for ﬁve years. In 1992
she sold the business and a year
later opened a store selling vintage
home goods, wallpaper, and fabric.
With about $23,000 in her pocket,

she had to buy her stock
carefully, mixing her own fabrics
and wallpaper with items from
tag sales and fabric from eastern
Europe. Gingham ordered from
Europe arrived already made
into duvet covers and
pillowcases, rather than as a
fabric bolt. Kidston realized she
would have to improvise, so
decided to “cut it up and make
it into other things.” She kept
some of the bedding, but altered
most items into products such
as toiletry bags. The Cath
Kidston brand was born.

The development of infrastructure
and the strength of a new layer of
middle management were key
factors in the evolution of UK retailer
Cath Kidston from a single store
in 1993 to more than 120 global
branches and concessions by 2013,
with stores throughout Europe and
Asia, and plans to expand into
North America. Widely renowned
for its vintage fabrics, wallpapers,
and brightly painted junk furniture,
Kidston’s initial growth, as is
common with many single-founder
start-ups, was slow. In the early
days, monthly accounts took six
weeks to prepare and clashes
between IT systems caused issues
with cash-ﬂow projections and
supply-chain management. It took
nine years to open a second branch,
and another two before the third.
Following a buy out in 2010,
Cath Kidston became partly owned
by a US private-equity group, with
Kidston herself retaining about 20
percent of stock. As expansion took
hold, the company started to move
from ad-hoc processes to a more
planned approach. Specialized
managers and consultants were
brought in to help build capacity for
growth. New departments were
added, including design, buying,
and merchandising, and systems
were introduced. Most importantly,
middle management gained
experience of what it takes to open
and run a new store. The lessons
from earlier mistakes were
integrated into procedures and
policies; by building on experience,
every new store opening became
easier than the last.

down, stiﬂing innovation and
hindering growth. As markets and
technology move ever faster,
process must not blind managers to
opportunity, and systems must not
restrict strategic agility. For
example, Motorola continued to
invest in satellite technology
throughout the 1990s even after
competitors had switched to
cheaper, more effective groundbased cell towers.
Habit can also twist logic. So
habitual, for example, were the
claims of ethical behavior from
Dennis Kozlowski, CEO of Swiss
security company Tyco International,
that he seemed able to divorce the
reality of his own behavior from his
rhetoric—in 2005 he was convicted
of corporate fraud. Habit can also
lead to hubris. Buoyed by his
business’s accomplishment in
electronics, in 1994 Samsung CEO
Lee Kun-Hee believed that the
same approach would lead to
success in the car market, but the
venture struggled and was rescued
in 2000 by Renault. The experience
(and habits) of Renault’s managers

have since helped Renault Samsung
Motors gain a footing within the
South Korean automotive market.
Business leaders dismiss the
value of middle management, and
the value of process, at their peril.
Without middle managers who are
able to evolve a leader’s vision into
reality, many businesses would be
stuck like those of the pre-railroad
era, destined to remain small, local,
and family run. It is the science of
management that enables business
evolution and growth. ■

ust as human beings are
organisms that grow,
change, and adapt, so do
successful businesses. In 1970, the
US futurist Alvin Tofﬂer published
Future Shock, a book that predicted
the coming phenomenon of “a
perception of too much change
in too short a period of time.” The
pace of change, he said, would also
spread to the world of business, as
companies were forced to adapt
their products and processes to
maintain advantage in an
increasingly competitive market.
Tofﬂer’s ideas of the effects of
rapid technological change were
viewed at the time as far-fetched,
but with the invention of computers
and the Internet, change has
accelerated even more rapidly than
he predicted. Tofﬂer presciently
claimed that we would live in a
state of “high transience,” in which
we would give ideas, organizations,
and even relationships an evershorter amount of our time. Social
media websites are witness to this
idea in action, providing a platform
for the new ways we have begun
relating to one another; they also
demonstrate new ways of starting,
growing, and building businesses.

Businesses must respond
to change through
innovation…

Adaptation
and reinvention
are necessary
for business
survival.

The reinvention of daily life
means marching off the
edge of our maps.

In 1989, US computer scientist
Alan Kay claimed that it took 10
years for an innovation to go from
the laboratory to everyday life, but
by 2006 Twitter had managed to
cut this down to just four years.
Products can now be bought online
from anywhere in the world, and
customer feedback is instant and
global. The challenge for companies
to adapt and reinvent is huge.

landscape has changed so radically

corporation has proved immune to

its effects. Consider, for example,
the music and movie industries.
New technology has completely,
and very rapidly, changed the
way that movies and music are
purchased and consumed. For the
big movie and music businesses
(and all their associated suppliers
and producers), survival has
required a high level of reinvention
and adaptation.
This reinvention has come in the
form of both new products and new
processes. Product adaptation
involves updates and redesign—
essentially, innovation and
invention. The movie industry has
undergone many transformations
since the early days of black-andwhite moving pictures, or “movies.”
It has reinvented itself through
technology (from adding sound to
creating “impossible” computergenerated images); marketing
devices, such as monthly access
cards; events, such as outdoor
screenings; and the growth of the
multiplex to multiply visitor
numbers and reduce turnaround
times. The newest product aimed
at luring viewers away from illegal
downloads and back into movie
houses is Stereoscopic-3D—itself a
reinvention of an older idea.
Around the turn of the 21st
century, the music industry was
also struggling because of the drop
in sales of CDs, and began to refocus
on live music and merchandise.
However, both the music and movie
industries found new life through
digitization, such as Apple’s iPod
and iTunes. This revolutionary
combination of product and
process—Apple’s hardware and
software—made legal downloads of
music and movies more attractive
than illegal versions. In 2013 the

Apple iTunes store offered 60,000
movies across 119 countries, and
35 million songs.

Innovative methods
Process adaptation involves ﬁnding
new ways to do things; it involves
introducing or removing processes.
Competition from online sales and
pirate streaming continue to affect
movie distribution companies such
as Netﬂix. The response of this
highly popular video streaming
service was to make all the episodes
of one television series (House
of Cards) available for download
simultaneously; the rationale being
that the risk of piracy would be
lower if consumers were able to
legally buy all episodes at once.
For Netﬂix this bold strategy was
not just a radical new process; it was
also an adaptation of the company’s
entire business model. Still in the
adolescent stages of growth, in 2012
Netﬂix was primarily an online
streaming service, but for House of
Cards it entered the world of
production. By producing and
distributing, Netﬂix was able to
capture more proﬁt and gain more
control over content. Netﬂix did not ❯❯

Thinking

Product adaptation in the music
industry demonstrates the steady use of
new technology—from gramophone to
vinyl, cassette, CD, minidisc, and MP3
digital music ﬁle—as companies have
sought to broaden the market for music.

56 REINVENTING AND ADAPTING
know if the House of Cards
experiment would work. It did know,
however, that in order to maintain
the momentum of early growth, it
needed to adapt and reinvent—in
this case reinvention as television
producers as well as distributors.

Internal changes
Reinvention and adaptation can also
be internally focused on systems,
recurrent tasks, or operational
activities. Whether improvement of
this type is based on data from
formal process improvement
frameworks (such as Total Quality
Management) or simply on the
experience and intuition of
managers, internal process
adaptation allows companies to
maximize revenue while also
reducing costs.
The McDonalds McSnack Wrap,
for example, takes staff only 21
seconds to make—the shorter the
preparation time, the greater the
number of customers that can be
served by the fewest staff. At R
Griggs Group Ltd, manufacturer of
Dr. Martens shoes, a reinvention of

internal systems allowed the
company to exploit global sales
opportunities. In 1994, due to the
brand’s growing popularity, demand
far exceeded manufacturing
capability. Poor planning and
coordination led to delayed
production and lost sales. The
solution was a reinvention of internal
systems based around an integrated
IT system. The product itself—the
classic “1460” eight-laced leather
boot—changed very little, although
more designs were later added to
the product range. The key change
was the adaptation of internal
processes, which ensured supply
could match demand.

Adapting in a recession
Internal process adaptation is even
more important in markets where
demand is static or falling.
Operational efﬁciencies, rather
than revenue growth, are the key
to proﬁt. For insurance companies,
for example, scope for new product
adaptation is limited, so competition
is price-based—especially in a
recession, when customers are
particularly price sensitive. The key
to maintaining proﬁtability while
remaining price competitive is
continual process improvement—
the reinvention of internal systems
that deliver the same product to
customers, but at a lower cost and,
therefore, increased proﬁtability.
The days of the door-to-door
insurance salesperson have long
since been replaced by telesales
and an e-commerce approach.

Reinventing the company

Dr. Martens footwear grew from a
niche fashion item to an international
mainstream hit within a matter of years.
R Griggs, the brand’s producer, had to
reinvent processes to match demand.

A notable company that has
successfully reinvented itself is
Samsung Electronics. Established
in 1969, Samsung Electronics is a
subsidiary of the Samsung Group,
which aimed to exploit opportunities

industry. The company began with
black-and-white televisions and
moved into home appliances during
the 1970s. In the 1980s, production
grew to PCs and semiconductors.
In 1986, Samsung released its
ﬁrst car phone, the SC-100. The
product was a disaster—the quality
was so poor that many customers
complained. This reputation for poor
quality blighted Samsung for much
of its early life, since consumers
regarded its goods as inferior to
premium Japanese products.
On June 7, 1993, chairman Lee
Kun-Hee gathered senior Samsung
executives and declared that the
company needed to reinvent itself.
His famous instruction “Change
everything except your wife and
children” shows how seriously he
took the situation. Lee also
recognized shifting market
dynamics, telling colleagues that
the company needed to “produce
cell phones comparable to Motorola’s
by 1994 ... or Samsung will
disengage itself from the cell-phone
business.” The “new management”
initiative that followed, supported
by product and process innovation,
put the emphasis on the quality
and innovation that Samsung is
now renowned for, and galvanized

its foundation for future growth.
Samsung’s transformation was not
yet complete, however—the Asian
ﬁnancial crisis of the late 1990s
forced the company to reinvent
itself yet again. Adapting its process
turned Samsung into a more
market-focused and consumerfriendly brand. Since then the
company’s efforts, particularly in
the cell-phone industry, have been
based on constant attrition,
reinvention, and adaptation.

Long-term survival
Few businesses survive without
adaptation or reinvention. Products
such as Kellogg’s Cornﬂakes and
Heinz Beans—products that have
not changed in decades—are rare.
Even when a product has not
changed, many of the processes
used in its manufacture,
distribution, and marketing have
altered dramatically. The factories
of 100 or 50 years ago were very
different than today’s, where many

Lee Kun-Hee

tasks are automated and fulﬁlled by
computers and robots. Promotions
have also adapted to ﬁt changed
consumer demographics, globalized
markets, and customer preferences.
Even established brands cannot
avoid reinvention.
Truly successful business
transformation is rarely due solely to
discovering and commercializing
bold new ideas, technologies, and
products. The most successful
businesses know that reinvention is

a continual process. Social media,
for example, has created a market
shift that has required businesses of
all types to adapt; even record labels
now embrace the promotional value
of websites such as YouTube.
The ecosystem in which a
business operates is rarely, if ever,
static. Corporations exist in these
ecosystems as living organisms
that must adapt to survive; great
leaders know that failure to adapt
leads to extinction. ■

Born on January 9, 1942, Lee
Kun-Hee is Chairman of the South
Korean conglomerate Samsung.
Holding an economics degree from
Waseda University in Tokyo,
Japan, and an MBA from George
Washington University in the US,
Lee Kun-Hee joined the Samsung
Group in 1968 and succeeded
his father as Chairman on
December 1, 1987.
Samsung is the quintessential
example of a chaebol, a uniquely
Korean conglomerate that mixes
Confucian values with family ties
and government inﬂuence. Under
Lee’s stewardship, the company

has been transformed from a
Korean budget brand into a
major international force and,
alongside Sony, is one of the
world’s most prominent
Asian businesses. Samsung
Electronics, the conglomerate’s
most famous subsidiary,
is a leading developer of
semiconductors, TV screens,
and cell phones—with its
smartphones even outselling
the iPhone in many markets.
The Forbes 2013 Rich List
recorded Lee as the world’s
69th richest billionaire, and
the richest Korean.

1972 Larry Greiner outlines
ﬁve stages of business growth,
and their related crises, in
“Evolution and Revolution

can turn into frustration.
Periods of chaos often occur in
a start-up’s early life. As it matures,
the new business will pass through
various conceptual thresholds. In
1972 Larry Greiner identiﬁed these
as “crises of growth,” which he

Stages of growth
Greiner initially identiﬁed ﬁve
stages of growth, but later added
a sixth. The ﬁrst of these stages is
“growth through creativity.” During
this stage, the start-up is small and
growth is fueled by the enthusiasm
of its founders. Management
procedures, communications—and
even interactions with customers—
are usually informal and ad hoc.
However, as more staff joins and
production expands, more capital

will be required (perhaps from banks
or venture capitalists), and the need
for formal systems and procedures
increases. The founders—who
are likely to be technically or
entrepreneurially oriented—ﬁnd
themselves faced with their ﬁrst
crisis, as they become burdened by
management responsibilities that
they are ill-equipped to deal with.
This ﬁrst crisis is therefore one of
leadership: who will lead the
company out of confusion and solve
the new management problems?
Change of leadership required for
phase two may only be a question of
internal reorganization and a change
in style, abandoning the casualness
of the company’s early days in favor
of greater formality and more rigid
systems and procedures. But in

many cases the original founders
have neither the skills nor the desire
to take on more formal leadership.
In 2002, chef Jamie Oliver founded
Fifteen, a chain of restaurants that
also provide training opportunities
for disadvantaged young people.
As the chain grew, he handed over
the management to a CEO, so that
he could return to doing what he
does best: being a commercially
successful celebrity chef.
Under professional managers,
business growth continues in
an environment of more formal
structures and budgets, and with
the establishment of separate
functions, such as production
and marketing. This is the second
stage of growth, known as “growth
through direction.” As the new ❯❯

manager takes responsibility for
direction, mid-level supervisors or
managers act more as functional

begin to demand more freedom
to make decisions, leading to the
second crisis: “autonomy.” This crisis
can be solved by freeing the midlevel managers from bureaucracy
and allowing the company to
achieve “growth through delegation”
—Greiner’s third stage of growth.
Unburdened by the need to manage
day-to-day issues, senior
management can shift its attention
to strategy and long-term growth.

Stay small or grow?
At this point a start-up faces
perhaps the biggest crisis of all: a
crisis of control. The founders or
senior management may ﬁnd it
hard to give up responsibility for
decision making, even to trusted
boards. When this happens, the
founder may decide to remain
small—in essence, to limit growth
to the extent of their own control.
Such decisions are laudable. Not
all companies can be global and allconquering, and in fact, small- and
medium-sized enterprises dominate
the business landscape. Some

free. All businesses, of all sizes,
and regardless of growth aspirations,
will face uncertainties and
challenges. It does mean, however,
that the business will avoid the
requirements of the next stage:
“growth through coordination.”
During this fourth stage,
increasing centralization is
common. By this time the company
may be relatively large, with
operations controlled through a
head ofﬁce. The company may
appoint executives with experience
of managing large, diverse
businesses and introduce standard
operating procedures.
However, the introduction of
standard policies eventually leads
to the next crisis: a “red-tape
crisis,” in which increasing
bureaucracy stiﬂes operations,
and growth falters as a result.

A return to informality
Paradoxically, the ﬁfth stage,
“growth through collaboration,”
requires, in part, a return to the
earlier days of ﬂexibility. Systems
allow greater spontaneity,
teamwork is introduced, and matrix
(network) structures are used to
recapture the collaborative nature
of a start-up—in other words, the
organization tries to operate like a
lean, creative company once again.
Once this has been attained,
the next crisis relates to the limits
of internal growth. Under pressure
from shareholders to continually
improve returns, further growth
can only be achieved by developing
partnerships with complementary
organizations. By this sixth stage
a company is already big, possibly
very big. “Growth through
alliances” therefore suggests that
expansion will continue through
mergers, outsourcing, or joint
ventures—the company needs
to look beyond its own internal

capabilities, and the capacity of
its core markets, and seek
external growth.
The actual rate of growth—
in terms of customer numbers,
revenue, or proﬁts—within each
phase of the Greiner Curve will
vary, depending on the individual
company. Organizations such as
Facebook were already large by the
time they started to face crises of
delegation and control. Others may
remain small for many years,
perhaps never even reaching
the leadership-crisis stage.

Using the Greiner Curve
Knowledge of the Greiner Curve
can help start-up founders to
predict and manage the inevitable
crises of growth. Even when
enjoying the heady days of early
growth, entrepreneurs need to be
mindful of the steps required to
build the business further. They
must put structures in place as
soon as possible; the earlier that
formal systems and professional
management are introduced, the
less they will be resented and
resisted, and the stronger the
foundations for continued growth.

In this regard, the various crises
identiﬁed by the Greiner Curve can
be seen as natural transitions. An
organization must manage its way
through such transitions and
growing pains as it continually
deﬁnes and redeﬁnes the scope of its
operations, its values, and its overall
purpose. As Benjamin Franklin
observed, “without continual
growth and progress, such words
as improvement, achievement, and
success have no meaning.”

Large but agile
One company that seems to have
heeded the lessons of the Greiner
Curve is the Internet musicstreaming service, Spotify. The
organization’s Swedish founders,
Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon,
knew at the company’s inception
in 2008 that their aim was growth.
They also knew that they were not
willing to compromise the beneﬁts
that accompany the excitement
of a start-up business.
Spotify organizes itself around
project-based teams, called
“squads.” The organization is
divided into small clusters of
squads, with each squad running

as a start-up business. Mirroring
the beneﬁts enjoyed by companies
in Greiner’s ﬁrst stage, every squad
is fully autonomous, has direct
contact with its stakeholders,
and operates with minimal
dependency on other squads.
To deal with the various crises
of growth (such as autonomy and
red-tape), related squads are
grouped into “tribes.” The function
of the tribe is to support and enable
the activities of each squad, in
essence mirroring the role of
venture capitalists in incubating
new start-ups. The operation is
kept small and agile by limiting the
head count for each tribe to 100.
Spotify appears to have managed
to maintain a balance between the
beneﬁts of growth and the feel-good
elements of a start-up. The founders
nevertheless admit that the system
is not ﬂawless, and as the demand
for an organization-wide strategy
grows, it may be that even Spotify
will not escape the crises of growth
predicted by the Greiner Curve. ■

All growth depends upon
activity. There is no
development physically or
intellectually without effort,
and effort means work.

backgrounds usually needed a fulltime job to meet the living costs
of themselves and their families.
Without sufﬁcient savings, few
people could risk a new business
venture in the 20th century, but
today, starting a business is easier.

Micropreneurism
In the mid-2000s, the notion of a
micropreneur began to emerge. This
was an individual who ran a very
small business, often in addition to
full-time employment. The concept
gained popularity alongside the rise
of e-commerce, which made it
possible to launch a commercial
website and manage it nights and
weekends. Sales platforms, such as
those provided by eBay and the
Chinese online marketplace Taobao,
made it even easier, since they
dispensed with the need for a
website or payment systems.

These micropreneurs, who sell
everything from homemade fashion
items to antiques and secondhand
electronics, are risking very little
other than their own time—the
capital outlay can be as much or as
little as they are willing to risk. The
micropreneur’s skill lies in spotting
the right opportunity. In this way
the business can be as small or
large as time, and desire, allows.
For those who aspire to more
than running a business as a parttime hobby, the lean start-up path
is well trodden. Large companies
such as Hewlett-Packard and
Indian biotech Biocon both started
in their founders’ garages. Passion
was key—with very limited capital,
essential equipment was begged
and borrowed; friends and family
were used as (free) staff; and sleep
was sacriﬁced. The main resources
were time, skill, and tenacity.
The path is not straightforward,
however, and requires a deep
commitment, often in the face
of failure. As Jeff Bezos warned,
“invention requires a long-term
willingness to be misunderstood.” ■

Hewlett-Packard
Bill Hewlett, born 1913, and
Dave Packard, born 1912, were
close friends who graduated
as electrical engineers from
Stanford University. After his
marriage, Packard moved into
an apartment in Palo Alto,
California, with his wife, while
Hewlett camped out in a shed
on the grounds. A garage
belonging to the property
became a decidedly low-tech
workshop. From 1938 to 1939
the garage served as home,
think tank, lab, ofﬁce, and
production department. Bill and
David developed the 200A and
200B audio oscillators, which
became Hewlett-Packard’s
ﬁrst products.
Believed to be the ﬁrst US
technology company to launch
in a garage, Hewlett-Packard
was founded by the two
friends on an investment of
just $538. Today the
organization is one of the
world’s largest technology
companies, with sales in
excess of $27 billion in 2012.
The garage is designated a
historic landmark and is listed
on the United States National
Register of Historic Places.

You have to really believe
in yourself and know that, in
the worst-case scenario, if it
doesn’t work out, you still
built something really cool.

rowth from a small start-up
to a large multinational
company cannot be
achieved without leaders who are
passionate about their business
and who are inspirational to their
staff. Leading a business is, at its
core, about harnessing the power
of people.
One popular business aphorism
claims that “there are no business
problems, only people problems.”
Managing people is not easy; every
organization is a collection of
individuals, each with their own
philosophies, vulnerabilities,
drives, strengths, and weaknesses.
Effective leadership embraces
these differences and creates a
culture in which people can make

Good leadership consists
of showing average people
how to do the work of
superior people.

US industrialist (1839–1937)

the most of their talent. In other
words, leadership is about creating
capacity in others. It is about
imagining the future, determining
strategic direction, and aligning
the organization and its people to
a particular vision.

Leaders and managers
The very best leaders, as Steve
Jobs said, “put a dent in the
universe.” These leaders are not
bound by convention; they are able
to think outside the box, embracing
one-of-a-kind ideas that disrupt the
status quo in their favor. In today’s
hypercompetitive markets, the
leaders we celebrate do not only
outthink, outsmart, and outcompete
their rivals, they disrupt entire
industries. They change the game.
Rarely, though, do leaders
achieve greatness alone. Leaders
rely on managers. While leadership
is about vision, management is
about process, planning, budgeting,
structuring, and stafﬁng—tasks
that help an organization to keep
doing what it does. In The
Manager’s Job (1975), Henry
Mintzberg identiﬁed three broad
management roles: informational
(managing by information);
interpersonal (managing through
people); and decisional (managing
through action). Importantly,

Mintzberg noted that none of these
roles is exclusive or privileged.
Leading well often involves shifting
seamlessly between leadership and
management, and knowing when,
contextually, each role is most
appropriate to adopt.
Creating the organizational
capacity for continued success also
means putting together teams and
managing talent. An effective team
is a powerful thing. Individuals
perform better in teams; they are
more productive and more
innovative. Teams can also be selfmanaging; individuals support
each other and strive not to let the
team down. Effective teams require
less supervision and less direction
than individuals, and performance
is guided by group norms, not by
one individual’s expectations.
It is not surprising, then, that
great organizations recognize the
value of teams. Google, for example,
designs workstations so that staff
can easily collaborate. “Hangout
spaces” are adorned with funky
furniture and supplied with food to
allow teams to work and socialize.
Leaders at Google want employees
to interact; they recognize that by
encouraging teamwork, employees
enjoy greater job satisfaction and
creativity, and as a result,
innovation rises. To the beneﬁt of

LIGHTING THE FIRE 67

its staff and its bottom line, Google
knows that the best workplaces feel
like playgrounds—places where
people can imagine and invent.

Satisfaction and challenge
Creating an organizational culture
that embraces teamwork and
encourages creativity helps
companies address the perennial
question: “is money the motivator?”
Most ﬁnd the answer is “no.” Higher
pay might encourage an individual
to take a new job, it might encourage
people to move a little faster or to
work a little harder, but people soon
forget about the money and start to
focus on other things—such as job
satisfaction, challenge, and respect
from managers. Virgin Atlantic
airline, for example, is not known as
one of the highest payers, but is
regarded as a great place to work.
A strong organizational culture
is, therefore, essential to success.
Through tradition, history, and
structure, companies build a sense
of identity—a unique personality
deﬁned by the characteristic
rituals, beliefs, stories, meanings,
values, norms, and language that
determine the way in which
“things are done around here.”
Importantly for leaders,
managing people also means
managing oneself. Business history

is littered with examples of leaders
who, blinded by success, leapt into
ill-conceived initiatives or made
“bet-the-farm” decisions that
proved disastrous. “Deal fever”
can mean that warning signs are
ignored by leaders who feel they
can do no wrong. Successful
leaders, however, know that they
must ﬁght against the illusion of
invulnerability. They also realize
the dangers of wanting to be liked
or to conform. Great leaders know
that they must guard against
groupthink and “yes-man”
mentalities in themselves and
others, because such approaches
leave decisions unchallenged, and
allow ill-judged projects to proceed
without sufﬁcient due diligence.

Everyone experiences tough
times; it is a measure of your
determination and dedication
how you deal with them.
Lakshmi Mittal
Indian entrepreneur (1950–)

The best leaders accept that they
are not gods of management, and
that, in fact, occasionally being
told “no” can be more important
than always hearing “yes.”

Emotionally intelligent
Creating a culture where this kind
of challenge is the norm depends
upon diversity. In companies
with employees from diverse
backgrounds, where gender, race,
and age are balanced, the different
perspectives mean decisions are
more likely to be questioned.
Perhaps most importantly then,
and as recent research indicates,
the single most important trait for
successful leaders is emotional
intelligence. In his bestselling book,
Emotional Intelligence (1995), Daniel
Goleman describes ﬁve domains of
Emotional Intelligence (EQ): knowing
your emotions; managing them;
motivating yourself; recognizing
and understanding other people’s
emotions; and managing
relationships. Without EQ, a leader
can be technically brilliant and full
of great ideas, but still ineffective.
This is because a sole trader may
be able to survive on intuition
alone, but as soon as someone
else is employed, EQ becomes key.
Lighting the ﬁre means keeping
the sparks ﬂying for everyone. ■

tasks that help an organization to
keep doing what it does. Without
management, no matter how well
led, an organization would
disintegrate into disorganized
chaos. However, management
is not leadership—it will not lead
the company in new directions.

Decisive leadership
In 1990, John Kotter argued that
leadership is about dealing with
change and developing a vision
for the organization, often within
turbulent times. Leaders then
communicate their vision to the
rest of the company, and motivate
staff—especially managers—to
act in ways that will bring about
the required change. Leadership
is about setting the agenda and
empowering people to produce
useful change.

Organizing teams and

regarded leaders—such as Jack
Welch of General Electric, Steve
Jobs of Apple, and Jill Abramson
of The New York Times—have
been well documented.
Leaders have to be brave in
the face of uncertainty, standing
ﬁrmly behind their vision for the
company. They need to hold staff
accountable when things do not
go as planned, and make difﬁcult
decisions about who to hire or
ﬁre in order to develop an
organizational culture capable
of achieving their strategic vision.

The next generation
Truly great leaders know that they
will not be around forever, and one of
their most important tasks is to hire,
train, and nurture their successor.
They lead well by making sure
somebody is ready and waiting to
take over from them. Nine years
before his retirement, General
Electric CEO Jack Welch said, “from
now on, choosing my successor is
the most important decision I’ll
make. It occupies a considerable
amount of thought almost every day.”

Jill Abramson was the ﬁrst woman
to become executive editor of The New
York Times. She found that unpopularity
came “with the territory,” as Times’
chairman Arthur Sulzberger had warned.

It is common practice in many
companies to privilege leadership
over management, but it is unwise.
Great organizations value both:
leaders who can spot opportunities,
and managers who can make those
opportunities a reality. ■

Blending leadership and management

Leadership is lifting a person’s
vision to high sights, raising
their performance to a higher
standard, building a personality
beyond its normal limitations.

are the hallmark of Portuguese
soccer coach José Mourinho.

Successful sports teams,

a blend of good management

Mourinho achieves the rare
feat of excelling in both. As
a leader, he makes his mark

immediately. When he ﬁrst took
over Chelsea Football Club in
London, England, he called a

and familiarity of belonging to a
group helps people to avoid anomie,
and ﬁnd security and purpose.
The existence of groups serves
two purposes. Organizations, and
the groups within them, can be
seen as an expression of the human
desire to belong. As psychologist
Abraham Maslow identiﬁed in his
1943 paper “A Theory of Human
Motivation”, groups give us a sense

of belonging. Maslow believed
that there is a hierarchy of human
needs; once we have met the most
basic of needs—the physiological
ones, such as hunger and thirst—
we progress to the next: security.
When these needs are satisﬁed,
we move to the third basic need:
a sense of belonging. Once this
is met, we will proceed toward
increasing self-esteem through
achievement, and ultimately
toward self-actualization, by using
our inner talents with creativity.
When Maslow’s theory is
applied to the workplace, working
in groups and gaining a sense of
belonging make employees more
effective. With the need to belong
already addressed, individuals are
able to focus on other things, such
as a desire for achievement and the
practicing of inner talents. In this
way, the movement through the
stages of satisfying needs can
beneﬁt a company. Free from
anomie, groups are places where
human beings, and therefore ideas,
can ﬂourish. Teams that are

attract thousands of applicants as
a result. Moreover, creativity is not
only a potential source for ideas
that can yield economic value, but
is a vital asset for individuals and
companies operating in increasingly
changeable global markets.

Deﬁning creativity
Creativity involves the generation
of ideas, alternatives, or possibilities,
and the consideration of situations
or problems in novel ways. Invention
is the practical application of
creative thought. When successfully
realized, creativity and invention
are highly motivating. They allow
us to combine our innate desire for
autonomy, purpose, and mastery.
They also produce a sense of
achievement, which is a key element
in what Abraham Maslow described
as the “Higher Order Needs” of
motivation—the factors that allow us
to feel value and self-actualization.

When it was announced that the
Creative Director of Mulberry,
Emma Hill—who was largely
credited with the fashion label’s

in 2013, the company’s shares fell
by more than 9 percent. As Steve
Jobs proved at Apple, “thinking
differently” is not just cool or
quirky—it matters to staff, to
customers, and to investors.

Fostering creativity
The challenge is for companies to
balance creativity with ﬁnancial
prudence. Unbridled creativity
rarely leads to commercial success,
yet businesses are required to
make proﬁts in order to survive.
For Mulberry, it was a clash of
these values that resulted in Hill’s
departure. When the joined
company in 2007, Hill was
responsible for some of the label’s
biggest hits—notably its Alexa and
Bayswater handbags—and
presided over a period of signiﬁcant
innovation and growth. In 2013
though, with sales falling, the
brand’s management decided it
needed a new creative direction—
even the most creative brands
feel the need for reinvention.
As creative organizations know,
to the beneﬁt of their staff and
the bottom line, creativity and
invention—by everyone, everywhere,
and all of the time—are vital
ingredients for business success. ■

Emma Hill studied at the

US, Asia, and Australia—as
Creative Director in 2007.
At Mulberry, Hill’s creative
talent for designing handbags
carried by the likes of model

Del Rey resulted in waiting
lists for purchases. Thanks
to her expansion of the brand
into small leather goods
(such as brightly colored card

enjoyed stellar growth. When
she joined Mulberry the

Zeus represents the “club culture,”
in which relationships with the
leader are more important than
formal titles or positions. Apollo’s
“role culture” is deﬁned by
functions, divisions, rules, and
rationality. In Athena’s “task

who have the expertise to solve
problems. In Dionysus’s “existential
culture,” the organization exists to
support the individual’s needs.

behaviors, biases, and beliefs.

afﬁnity; proximity to the center of
the club reﬂects an individual’s

Athena, the goddess of wisdom,
was a problem-solver. Task cultures
thrive where innovation is required,
but struggle with routine.
Advertising agencies and
consultancies often display
task cultures.

Dionysus, the god of wine, stood
for individual freedom. In person
cultures, professional opinion is
privileged and management is seen
as an unnecessary burden.
Professional service companies,
such as legal ﬁrms, mirror

state of ﬂux—they adapt and
change in unforeseen, unplanned,
and unpredictable ways.

Accounting for complexity
Organizational complexity is often
measured by the number of
countries a company operates in,
or the number of brands under a
manager’s control. Such
institutional complexity is not
insigniﬁcant; it pales though
compared to individual complexity.
For example, something novel that
motivated a member of staff one

year may not motivate them the
next. When a company consists of a
staff of thousands, it is clear that
people, and therefore organizations,
are more complex than the stylistic
Gods of Management suggest.
Handy later wrote of the
Shamrock Organization—a ﬂexible
organization made of core employees,
peripheral outsourced staff, and an
external, ﬂexible work force. Each
category of worker has a different
commitment to the organization, a
different understanding of its vision,
and their own motivations for work.

Charles Handy
Professor Charles Handy, born
in 1932, is Britain’s bestknown management guru.
After graduating from Oxford
University he joined the
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in 1965, moving
to the London Business School
(LBS) in 1967 to run the only
Sloan School of Management
program outside the USA.
Handy’s challenging ideas,
articulate style, and use of
provocative imagery—such as
his text The Empty Raincoat,
a critique of the “impersonal
mechanics of business
organizations”—set him apart
from his contemporaries.
Handy sees himself as a social
philosopher rather than
management guru—his
writings, he believes, are
commentaries rather than
manuals for success. His
opinions have inﬂuenced
business thinking for decades.

The job of leadership is to align these
differences toward a common,
organizational goal.
Organizational dynamics are
important because people matter.
Typologies only take a leader so far.
Leaders must recognize that each
employee perceives the company
differently, and has unique drivers
(and barriers) to effectiveness. As

departure of a charismatic leader
can be hard to ﬁll. It may ﬂatter the
ego to be proclaimed a hero, but
great leaders know that success
involves building long-term
organizational capacity that will
outlast their own tenure.

Keys to effectiveness
To be effective, a leader must be
conﬁdent and secure, and at the
same time open and empathetic.
Effective leadership involves the
ability to create capacity in others
through the process of interacting,
informing, listening, developing,
and trust-forming. Credibility of
the leader is achieved through
collaboration, not domination.
Central to effective leadership is
empowerment—the art of enabling
other people to get things done.

Renault and Nissan. Within a
year of his appointment in 1999,
Ghosn returned Nissan to
proﬁtability and was credited with
saving the company from collapse.
This proved to be one of the most
dramatic turnarounds in modern
business history.
Among the leadership traits
that contribute to Ghosn’s
effectiveness is his belief that
leadership is learned “by doing.”
On joining Nissan as CEO he
walked around every factory,
meeting and shaking hands with
every employee. To this day he
remains a common sight on factory
ﬂoors. Integrity and trust, Ghosn
believes, are built when leaders are
seen to be willing to “get their
hands dirty” and remain in touch
with the factory ﬂoor of the business.

Empowering staff
Leaders must communicate a strong
vision but, above all, they must
empower staff to make decisions
themselves. In large, diverse
organizations a leader cannot, and
should not, make all the decisions—
helping others to understand the
necessity for change, and giving
them the tools to manage that
change is key to the leader’s role.
The success of Nissan is also
attributed to Ghosn’s ability to
manage cross-cultural teams.
Leaders, Ghosn suggests, require
the ability to listen and to empathize,
not just with employees from their
own countries, but also with people
from different countries and cultures.
Ghosn’s insights illustrate that
effective leadership requires putting
vision into action. Achieving this
requires more than just rhetoric:
effective leaders must “talk the talk”
and “walk the walk.” ■

that forming a team leads to

the University of Cambridge, and
then a doctorate in psychology,
during which he did research on
the importance of teamwork. He

E

ffective teams are the key
to great organizations.
This is especially true in
business, where teamwork merges
individual talent into something
greater than the sum of its parts,
enabling “common people to attain
uncommon results” in the words of
US industrialist Andrew Carnegie.
Manufacturing companies in
Europe and the US began to explore
the idea of teamwork in the 1960s
and 1970s, in response to the
success of Japanese team-based
working methods such as kaizen
(staff are responsible for a company’s
continuous improvement) and
“quality circles” (groups of staff
tasked with improving quality). In
the 1980s, as many companies
adopted “total quality management”
(organization-wide quality),
teamwork began to spread beyond
its genesis in manufacturing.
Today, it would be rare to ﬁnd an
organization, of any type or size,
that did not value teamwork.

in proﬁt, and improved job
satisfaction. In Honeywell’s
commercial ﬂight division in
Minneapolis, for example, teamwork
was credited with achieving an
80 percent market share in ﬂight
and navigation systems—and for
generating proﬁts that were
200 percent higher than projections.
Teams succeed because they
provide an environment where
weaknesses can be balanced out
and individual strengths multiplied.
Teams also safeguard against
individual shortcomings, such as
underperformance and personal
agendas. Projects are more likely to
stay on track when peers support
each other and review each other’s
and the team’s work. Teams also
create an environment that most
people enjoy. The security of a group
makes each individual feel less
exposed and, in turn, more likely to
take risks, be more creative, and
therefore be better able to perform.

Storming and norming
Effective teams take time to
develop. It is rare that a group of
people can come together and
begin to perform immediately; most
teams go through a series of stages
before effectiveness is achieved.
Bruce Tuckman, a US professor of

educational psychology, described
these stages as forming, storming,
norming, performing, and
adjourning. During forming, the
group comes together, and
members get to know one other. It
then moves into a storming stage,
where members challenge each
other for coveted group roles, and
group processes begin to emerge
through trial and error. The middle
stage—norming—marks a period
of calm, where agreement is
reached on roles, processes, and
group norms. By the fourth stage,
members have become familiar
with each other, with their roles,
and with the processes involved.
At this stage, team performance
hits its most effective level. Once
their work is done, the group moves
to adjourning, or disbanding.
Businesses are eager for teams
to move quickly through the early
stages, reaching “performing” as
soon as possible. This is why
companies invest so much in teambuilding activities, where teams
face and solve artiﬁcial challenges,
often in a different environment.
Many companies also use the
architecture of their building to
encourage team interaction. For
example, at Pixar, the movie
animation studio based in
California, the cafeteria, meeting
rooms, employee mail boxes, and
bathrooms are located around a
centralized atrium designed for
collaborative working. The building
design and layout encourages
members of teams to meet and
interact with one another, even
when they are based in different
departments within the company.
Research has shown that teambuilding activities and collaborative
work spaces help to improve team

work because the most effective
teams are those where members
trust one another, share a strong
sense of group identity, and have
conﬁdence in their effectiveness
as a team.

Effective team building
In 2005, US researchers Jon
Katzenbach and Douglas Smith
identiﬁed a series of factors that
seem to be essential for effective
teamwork. First, team members
must be chosen for their skills, not
their personality. The team then
needs to get off to a good start;

setting the right tone is essential.
The tone should not be too
casual—teams perform better
when challenged, so a sense of
urgency needs to be imparted.
The team should agree on clear
rules for group behavior and norms,
and meet often, both formally and
informally. If possible, the team
should be allowed to enjoy some
early success; a few easy wins
early on has been found to boost
performance later. Likewise,
the group—and its individual
members—needs to be lavished
with praise. Continuing motivation ❯❯

Successful roles
Individuals offer different talents
and attributes, and these need to
be taken into account when putting
together teams. UK management
theorist Meredith Belbin claims
there are nine distinct roles within
a team that are essential to team
success, and that the key to a wellorganized team is balance. For
example, Belbin found that teams
without Plants (creative,
unconventional thinkers) struggle
to come up with ideas; but if there
are too many Plants, idea generation
starts to take precedence over
action. Similarly, if there is no
Shaper (a dynamic, driven person
who pushes the group toward
decisions), teams lack drive and
direction. But in a team with too
many Shapers, arguments occur
frequently and will lower morale.
Now an established business
tool, the Belbin Team Inventory is
frequently used by companies to
maximize team effectiveness.
However, many companies make the
mistake of using it after teams have
been formed; to work successfully, it
must be used before creating a team.

Managing talent
Sir Alex Ferguson, former manager
of Manchester United, one of the
world’s best-known soccer teams,
is a master of building winning
teams over and again, and his
methods can be applied to the
business environment. His team
was bonded by a strong sense of
shared mission—a desire to win.
Players were cohesive on the ﬁeld,
because Ferguson demanded
cohesiveness off the ﬁeld. An
exceptional team culture ran
through the veins of every player

and every staff member. Ferguson
realized the value of positive group
norms. He was, for example, one
of the ﬁrst managers to ban the
consumption of alcohol. Moreover,
alongside a host of team-building
activities—quizzes on the team
bus, for example—he demanded
ferocious loyalty. Players could
expect unfailing public support from
Ferguson and the team. Equally,
players were expected to observe a
code of media silence in regard to
teammates. Anyone breaching this
team ethic was quickly ousted.
Team management often
involves dealing with large egos
and highly talented people. Ferguson
recognized that it was folly to rein
in signiﬁcant talent—players Eric
Cantona and Cristiano Ronaldo
were both encouraged to express
their soccer-playing ﬂair—but he
also transferred highly skilled
players who felt themselves to be
more important than the team.
Talent management is a source
of frustration for many executives,

of teamwork. By ﬂying together, each
one reduces air resistance for the ones
behind. They rotate leadership and
“talk” continuously by honking.

because talented people often
resist being managed, and it
can be difﬁcult to ﬁnd challenges
that keep them sufﬁciently
motivated, while at the same
time aligned with organizational
goals. However, teams provide
an environment where talent can
thrive. By giving talented staff
teams to manage, or—although
risky—grouping talent together
in teams, it is possible to stretch
even the most gifted member of
staff. Teams provide a framework
and value system to which all
members, however skilled or
talented, must adhere.

Collective products
Businesses, like sports teams,
face performance challenges for
which teams are a powerful
solution. This is because teams
are not simply a group of people
who work together; they are judged
not by individual performance,
but by their “collective work
products.” These are the pieces
of work—which might be products,
surveys, or experiments—that
come about as a result of joint

contributions. In The Wisdom
of Teams, Jon Katzenbach and
Douglas Smith deﬁned a team as
“a small number of people with
complementary skills who are
committed to a common purpose,
set of performance goals, and
approach, for which they hold
themselves mutually accountable.”
No individual is responsible for
success or failure, because no one
acts alone. Teamwork encourages
listening, responding constructively
to the views of others, providing
support, and recognizing the
interests, skills, and achievements
of the other team members.
Most successful teams are
formed in response to a perceived
threat or opportunity. When these
arise, the role of senior leaders is to
organize teams with clear purpose,
balanced membership, disciplined
procedures, and strong bonds,
while giving them enough
ﬂexibility to develop their own
timing and approach. By doing so,
leaders create environments where
individuals—and therefore the
organization—are able to succeed
and ﬂourish. ■

The bold retreat
Linear thinking—the opposite of
thinking outside the box—has been
responsible for the downfall of
many businesses. MySpace, a
website that dominated the online
social-media market in the early
2000s, is an example of a business
that fell victim to strategic
retrenchment—sticking to a failing
strategy rather than adapting to
new competition or a changing
marketplace. Purchased by News

business was sold in 2011 for $35

sophisticated games, the Nintendo
Wii created a whole new market. Its
unique player interface—with a
range of handheld, wireless
controllers—and focus on groupbased gaming made it familyfriendly; suddenly gaming was a
social activity for gamers of all ages
and experience levels. The console
quickly outsold the competition in
almost every territory.
Leaders taking this kind of “bold
retreat” willingly cede technological
advantage or market position to the
dominant player, pursuing instead
less vulnerable (and often more
proﬁtable) market positions.

wages at Ford Motor Company
in an effort to reduce labor

for jobs with the company.

When present,
motivators—such as
recognition, professional
growth, and responsibility—
can contribute to job
satisfaction.

1959 Fredrick Herzberg
proposes his theory that
“motivators” and “hygiene
factors” lead to satisfaction
or dissatisfaction at work. He
stresses that pay demotivates,
but it does not motivate.
2000s “Best Employer” lists

companies are often not those
offering the biggest salaries.
2012 Fortune magazine cites
Google as the best organization
to work for in the US, and it
also tops the list of employers
in developing countries,
including India. High salaries
and a range of perks contribute
to staff satisfaction.

If poorly managed,
hygiene factors—such as
pay, conditions, supervision,
and security—can increase
job dissatisfaction.

Money matters, but workplace motivation is much

f you were paid more, would

is probably partly yes, and
partly no. Higher pay might
encourage you to move to a new job

equally, magniﬁed—by other factors,
such as job satisfaction, respect
from managers, and the challenge
presented by the work itself.
Financial gain can move us

complex than money alone. US
psychologist Professor Frederick

Herzberg began to study workplace
motivation in the 1950s while
teaching at Case Western Reserve
University, OH. In 1959 he proposed
the “two-factor theory”—that a
series of “motivators” encourage job
satisfaction, while aspects of work
termed “hygiene factors” contribute
to dissatisfaction in the workplace
if they are poorly managed.

Removing dissatisfaction
Hygiene factors include working
conditions, job security, relationships
with other workers, and salary.

Frederick Herzberg
US psychologist Frederick
Herzberg was born on April
18, 1923. He attended City
College of New York and later
held a professorship at the
University of Utah, USA.
Herzberg’s service in the
US Army, in particular his
observation of conditions
at the Dachau concentration
camp in Germany during
World War II, is thought to
have inspired his interest
in motivational theory.
Challenging the notion
that workers are driven only
by money and other beneﬁts,
Herzberg suggested that
achievement and recognition
are powerful motivators. He
believed that managers should
create safe, happy workplaces
and make tasks interesting,
challenging, and rewarding.
His work inﬂuenced a
generation of managers.
Key works

Motivators include recognition,
responsibility, the opportunity for
advancement, a sense of personal
achievement, and potential for
growth—as Herzberg put it “the
more a person can do,” the more
easily they can be motivated.
Herzberg argued that job
dissatisfaction is as important
as satisfaction. He believed that
unless hygiene factors were well
managed, no matter how good the
motivators, staff would not be
inclined to work hard. They would,
he suggested, be so dissatisﬁed as
to be demotivated. He also believed
that hygiene factors do not, in
themselves, motivate; but when
fulﬁlled, they reduce dissatisfaction
and provide a foundation for
motivation. On the other hand,
motivators have great potential to

increase job satisfaction, but when
lacking, actually only result in low
levels of employee dissatisfaction.

Motivators in practice
Herzberg’s ﬁndings are signiﬁcant
for business leaders. The two-factor
theory proposes that job design is
crucial—it must create conditions
in which employees can feel a sense
of achievement, enjoy responsibility,
and gain recognition for their work.
Levels of pay may be important for
recruitment and retention, but it
is less important in encouraging
staff to work effectively.

“friends and family contract”—in
which employees from the same
family or friendship group can cover
each other’s shifts—give staff a
sense of shared responsibility, and
enhance loyalty to the company.
The top-paying companies are
rarely ranked as the best employers.
Money matters, but job satisfaction,
career advancement, management
attitude, and personal relations are
the workplace factors that most
motivate us to work harder. ■

do things differently—
people such as Facebook CEO
Sheryl Sandberg, US investor
Warren Buffett, Hong Kong business
magnate Stanley Ho, British
entrepreneur Richard Branson,
and US media giant Oprah Winfrey.
Similarly, the companies we
remember are those whose products
and services stand out. Companies
that shufﬂe along with the crowd,
doing the same thing in the same
old way, are soon forgotten; those
that disrupt industries and change
the game are celebrated, sometimes
even idolized.
In today’s global market,
competition is ﬁerce and every
percentage point of market share is
hard fought and precious. Operating
in these markets is often a zero-sum
game: competition drives prices
down and costs up. Gaining a
signiﬁcant competitive advantage
requires more than gradual
improvement, it demands radical
and disruptive shifts—if you cannot
win the game, move the goalposts.
Redeﬁning the rules and boundaries
of an industry is the essence of
game-changing business strategy.

Entrepreneur and inventor
Steven Paul Jobs was born on
February 24, 1955 in San
Francisco, California, US. In 1976,
at the age of 21, he and Steve
Wozniak started Apple Computers
(from the garage in Jobs’s home).
The business went public in 1980,
with a market value of $1.2 billion.
In 1985, after disagreements
with the board, Jobs was ﬁred
by recently appointed CEO John
Sculley. Jobs nevertheless went
on to found NeXT Computer and
invest in Pixar Animation Studios,
which was to become hugely
successful. In a twist of corporate

Disruptive innovation
Harvard Business School scholar
Clayton Christensen identiﬁed
two types of technology that can
inﬂuence businesses: ”sustaining
technologies,” or advances in
technology that help companies
make gradual improvements to
product performance; and
“disruptive technologies,” radical
advances in technology that disrupt
the industry and force companies to
rethink their entire mode of being.
Christensen later changed the term
“disruptive technology” to
fate, Apple bought NeXT in 1996
and Jobs returned to Apple later
that year, becoming CEO in
1997. In 1998 Jobs launched the
iconic iMac computer and went
on to preside over one of the
most famous corporate
renaissances in history. Under
his guidance, Apple led the way
with innovative product design
and technology to become one
of the most valuable technology
businesses in the world.
In 2010, Steve Jobs was 61st
in Time Magazine’s “100 People
who Changed the World.”
He died on October 5, 2011.

PERFORMANCE

Disruptive innovation refers to
an innovation that transforms the
market. When an existing product
boasts more features or services
than customers require, it may
become too complex or difﬁcult
to use. As the gap between the
existing product’s performance
and customer requirement grows,
it creates a gap in the market

Leaders like the company’s
founder, Werner von Siemens—
those with the vision and courage
to pursue game-changing
strategies—are, however, all too
rare. It takes great courage to break
from tradition; and charisma and
conviction to lead individuals,
organizations, and entire industries
away from the status quo. Success
is met with reward and celebration;
failure with ridicule and scorn.
For would-be game changers, the
line between fame and infamy is
often thin.

occasions, is Apple. Under the

is a classic reaction to a game

unlikely to have shifted the market
very far—true game changers raise
eyebrows and prompt questions.

Interfacing technologies
The iPod was a cross between the
early crop of low-storage MP3
players and the large, hard-drivebased players that provided several
gigabytes of storage. Amid a sea of
bland competing products, the iPod
stood out thanks to its stylish and
distinctive design. It was small, easy
to use, and came with the promise
of “1,000 songs in your pocket.”
The real disrupter, however, was
the combined power of the iPod
and its software interface, iTunes.
Customers could now access a
huge amount of music from one
place, buy it, download it, and
“sync” music from their computer
to their devices with ease. The
iPod could also be charged while
syncing. The fact that we now
take such features for granted
demonstrates the extent to which
Apple transformed the market
for personal-music devices.

LIGHTING THE FIRE 97
The iTunes Music Store (now the
iTunes Store) redeﬁned the music
industry in 2003. At the time, digital
music piracy was on the rise; record
labels were ﬁghting against digital
distribution for fear of losing control
and further damaging already
declining revenues. Jobs exploited
the record executives’ nervousness
to his advantage, offering people a
way to purchase music legally but
easily and instantly.
Apple’s software changed the
music industry’s business model
forever. In addition to changing the
way we access and listen to music,
iTunes enabled people to buy single
tracks from albums. Artists no
longer needed to slave for months
on albums, but could release a
steady stream of singles instead.
Consumers no longer felt trapped
into album purchases and felt less
need to search for free, pirated
downloads in place of legal versions.
The Apple logo has become a global
emblem of the modern age—an
indication of the extent to which
the organization has revolutionized
technology and product development.

The iTunes Store and the iPod
system, quite simply, worked for
consumers, who had been bafﬂed
by the many MP3 players and online
methods of ﬁnding music. Apple
simpliﬁed the process, and made
its solution aesthetically appealing
at the same time. By 2013, its
strategy had brought sales of around
400 million iPods and more than
25 billion iTunes Store downloads.

It’s kind of fun to do
the impossible.
Walt Disney
US entrepreneur (1901–1966)

Continually game-changing
Such radical disruption, if achieved
only once, could be put down to
good luck, but true game changers
are those who persistently seek
to separate themselves from the
competition. Steve Jobs was not
content merely to have changed the
music industry: in 2007 he turned
his attention to the cell-phone
industry. Cell phones had been
getting smarter for a while, but the
iPhone was a giant leap forward.
Offering users access to a suite
of computer-like applications and,
in particular, seamless Internet
access, it was an instant hit. The
real breakthrough was the iPhone’s
touch-screen technology. Jobs

called the iPhone “a revolutionary
product,” claiming it was “ﬁve
years’ ahead of any other cell
phone.” His words were prophetic:
for some years after, the iPhone
remained the standard against
which all other cell phones
were assessed and deﬁned.
Shortly before his death in 2011,
Jobs did it again—this time with
the iPad. Launched in April 2010,
to confusion and some cynicism,
the iPad came to (re)deﬁne the
industry. It extended access to
technology beyond its accepted
business, educational, and ❯❯

desktop-bound roots, in a format
that few, at ﬁrst, expected to be
popular. The iPad ushered in
a new era of computing, and
remains, even in an increasingly
crowded tablet-computer marketplace, the industry standard.

Corporate culture
Apple has changed the game so
signiﬁcantly that the brand has
entered the cultural zeitgeist: its
products are seen everywhere—
from coffee shops and classrooms
to television shows. Apple’s
technology has made its products
ubiquitous and its customers
fanatically brand loyal. With such a
competitive edge, it is no surprise
that the company’s prices are able
to sit well above industry averages.
But the challenge for any
organization is to ensure that
such game-changing mentality
informs the spirit of the whole
company. As French businessman
Pierre Omidyar, founder of the
online auction site eBay, suggests,
a leader must be “a catalyst for

eBay, has embedded the desire for
innovation and dramatic change within

change.” But to be truly successful,
and to outlive the tenure of a highly
driven leader, the desire to disrupt
must be pervasive. The energy,
innovation, and courage required
to repeatedly disrupt industries
must be deeply ingrained in the
corporate culture, which must also
allow for ﬂexibility to change.
In the case of eBay, Omidyar
realized that the future was
unpredictable and nonlinear,
and decided to structure his new
venture with the approach of a
software engineer (his former job),
“who has learned to strive for
ﬂexibility in design.” While a
software program might seem
initially to provide more than its
customers need, this is what gives
it the ﬂexibility to change and
“prepare for the unexpected.”
Ebay’s self-sustaining system
required little intervention and was
able to adapt and grow according
to customer needs. Its design
effectively embedded disruption
within the core structure. The idea
of allowing users to rate each other
was both new and risky—as was
a business model that required

users to do most of the work. These
features nevertheless ensured
that eBay evolved not only around
Omidyar’s ideas and energy, but
also around the requirements of the
entire eBay community.

Embracing failure
However, such deeply embedded
game-changing mentality is rare.
Heroic leaders—game changers and
risk takers—are difﬁcult to ﬁnd and

LIGHTING THE FIRE 99
are rarely brave enough, or
conﬁdent and committed enough
in their ideas, to stake their careers
and reputations on risky gamechanging innovations. The heroic
leader’s strength lies not just in
their vision, but also in their
willingness to stand in the
spotlight when things go wrong.
Corporate history is littered
with examples of failed products.
Most businesses are therefore, by
nature, risk averse. Even Apple has
made mistakes—and, again, its
example is instructive. Jobs may be
best remembered for transforming
the music, computer, and phone
industries, but he’ll also be
remembered as the poster boy for
embracing failure, and bouncing
back from it. He has reigned over
a long list of failures. The Pippen
games console, for example, was
unable to compete with the likes
of Sony’s Playstation, and was
quickly dropped. The Apple III
computer suffered major design
faults, and the Lisa—a computer
that would eventually provide the
basis for the iMac—had poor sales.
The Apple Newton, a forerunner of
today’s smartphones, was a ﬂop.
These failures led to Jobs being
ﬁred in 1985. In a speech to students
graduating from Stanford University
in 2005, Jobs stated that the
dismissal triggered him to change
his own game: “The heaviness of
being successful was replaced by
the lightness of being a beginner
again, less sure about everything.
It freed me to enter one of the most
creative periods of my life.”
History is ﬁlled with examples
of trailblazers who stumbled before
ﬁnding success. KFC chicken,

was rejected by more than 1,000
restaurants; R. C. Macy opened and

Adopting such a strategy means
that shareholders must be tolerant
of risk and uncertainty, and patient
with regard to returns; payback
periods may be long, and rewards
difﬁcult to measure. But if allowed
to ﬂourish, this longer-term approach
enables a business to build a
stronger brand, invest in research
and development, create better
business processes, and avoid
taking (possibly damaging) actions
to boost short-term proﬁts.

Innovator’s Dilemma suggests,
game-changing leaders are not
bound by incremental change and
“me-too” thinking: they rewrite the
terms of competition by embracing
unique ideas, and recognize that
in a corporate world characterized
by the mantra “change or die,”
disrupting the status quo in your

step, but several steps ahead of
the competition. In today’s

morale is high. However, as a result

successful companies there is a
risk that staff members will
become arrogant, and will begin
to regard their success as a right
or entitlement. Managers lose sight
of the underlying factors that
created success in the ﬁrst place,
overestimating their own strengths
and those of the business.
If stage 1 is a feeling that “we’re
so great, we can do anything!”
stage 2 is characterized by the
feeling that “we should do more!”

102 HUBRIS AND NEMESIS
Continued management arrogance
breeds indiscipline; decisions are
made out of greed and warning
signs are ignored. Companies at
stage 2 make indisciplined leaps
into areas where they have little
competitive advantage; diversify
into areas in which they have no
expertise; or undertake ill-conceived
mergers and takeovers. The
complacency of stage 1 turns into
the overreaching of stage 2.
By stage 3, problems begin to
mount, staff begins to question
management decisions, and
disturbing data suggest things
might not be all that they seem.
However, as Collins points out, it is
possible to be in stage 3 of decline
and not yet realize that it is
happening. Anomalies in
performance at this stage tend to be
explained away; any problems are
blamed on “difﬁcult trading
conditions.” Management holds ﬁrm
in the view that the company is
strong and nothing is fundamentally
wrong. They believe that once the

markets pick up, their business
brilliance will ensure that the
company regains market leadership.

Now or never
Stage 3 represents the turning point.
Many companies reach this stage
but manage to avert collapse. If
management listens to the views of
its staff (especially from the front
lines, such as sales staff), heeds
shareholder concerns, and changes
strategy in line with the changing
reality, it is likely to recover. Andy
Grove famously pulled Intel back into
proﬁtability by pursuing this strategy.
However, the same cannot be said
for Lehman Brothers. In 2007, with
its stock price at a record high, the
US investment bank ignored the
early warning signs of collapse. Even
as cracks in the US housing market
became apparent, with subprime
mortgage defaults rising to a sevenyear high, Lehman continued to
expose itself to mortgage-backed
ﬁnancial products. Management,
particularly the chief executive,
Richard Fuld, were blinded by hubris
and deep in denial. They pressed on
with ill-conceived strategies and
quickly found themselves in stage 4.

Dealing with disaster

“Rogue trader” Jérôme Kerviel
claimed his company, Société Générale
bank, was aware of his dangerously
large trades, but turned a blind eye
because they were focused on proﬁts.

By stage 4 a company’s difﬁculties
become undeniable—even the
most headstrong and arrogant
manager has to acknowledge that
there are problems. The question
now is how to respond. Unfortunately,
as the Lehman example shows,
acknowledgment does not always
result in appropriate action.
As the global credit crisis
erupted in August 2007, Lehman’s
stock fell sharply. Having grown

bank and journalists asked
questions about its future, Fuld
was reluctant to countenance any
capital infusion. Selling parts of the
bank was not an option he felt he
could consider. Although Fuld
eventually revoked this decision, it
was too late: the bank declared
bankruptcy on September 15, 2008.
The way in which management
responds to a crisis brought about
by success and accompanying
hubris is critical. Inevitably, “bandaid” solutions that do not address
the underlying problems rarely
succeed. Quick ﬁxes based on the
same overconﬁdence that brought
crisis in the ﬁrst place—such as a
bold but risky strategy, a hoped for
blockbuster product, or a “marketchanging” acquisition—usually
result in the company moving
to stage 5: capitulation to
irrelevance, or death.

Capitulating to irrelevance
In stage 5, reality ﬁnally hits home.
Expensive failed strategies erode
ﬁnancial strength and accumulated
setbacks damage the individual
spirits trying to repair the damage.
Key managers generally leave the

other brands. The once-mighty
company has ﬁnally fallen. A
management buy out, merger, or
takeover may save the business
and protect some jobs, but the
company is unlikely to ever
recapture its former glory. Most,
having slipped this far, survive (if
they survive at all) as niche brands
trading on past history.

Return to glory
Decline is, of course, not inevitable
for all successful companies. Those
that reach the later stages of
corporate decline do so because
managers failed to heed the early
warning signs of change or were
irrationally sure of their ability to
“beat the odds.” However, it is
possible to reach stage 4 and
recover. According to Collins,
this involves taking a calm, clearheaded approach and reaching not
for savior strategies, but for the
basic core values and disciplines
that made the organization great
in the ﬁrst place.
Steve Jobs did just that at
Apple. In the late 1980s and early
1990s, the company’s management
perceived Apple as vastly superior,
ignored increasing competition
from PC manufacturers, and
expected customers to dismiss
quality and compatibility issues as
“quirks.” After the 1995 release of
Microsoft’s Windows 95 operating
system, Apple fell into decline.
Sales, proﬁts, and Apple’s image
tumbled. BusinessWeek called it
“the fall of an American icon.” The
CEO, Gil Amelio, cut costs,
reorganized the company, and
added a new Internet Services

Group. By 1997, Apple was months
from bankruptcy, as the business
continued to spiral out of control.
A new board assembled and called
for the return of one of the
cofounders—Steve Jobs—as CEO.
Many expected him to respond
with a slew of new products, but
he did the opposite. He shrank the
company to a size that reﬂected
its niche position, and cut back the
desktop computer models from
15 to one. He ended production of
printers, cut software development,
and moved production abroad. He
redesigned the company around a

simpliﬁed product line, sold through
a limited number of outlets. He
stabilized Apple and allowed a
return to its core values—a focus
on innovation and quality—that
later brought iconic products such
as the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad.

The pursuit of less
Hubris is not the single cause of
business failure. Even the most
skilled management may fail when
faced with turbulent markets, the
collapse of a key supplier, or other
factors beyond their control (the
2008 credit crunch, for example,
was the ﬁnal blow for an already
struggling Woolworths). Hubris
may occasionally be a factor in
corporate decline, but failure may
also result from poor business
practice or simply from bad luck.
However, if overconﬁdence
leads to an “undisciplined pursuit
of more,” the remedy seems to be
the disciplined pursuit of less—a
return to a company’s strategic
roots. Ego, though, is a powerful
thing, and humility is too rarely
the tool managers reach for when
ﬁghting for survival. ■

Culture impacts every aspect
of business behavior.

Culture is a signiﬁcant determinant
of organizational success or failure.

1940s, human relations experts
began to consider organizations from
a cultural point of view, drawing
inspiration from earlier sociological
and anthropological work associated
with groups and societies. However,
the term “organizational culture”
only became part of the business
lexicon in the early 1980s, following
the publication of Culture’s
Consequences by the Dutch cultural
psychologist and management
expert Geert Hofstede.
Looking closely at organizational
structure for the ﬁrst time, Hofstede
observed that it is shaped by and

overlaps with societal culture. He
identiﬁed ﬁve dimensions of culture
that inﬂuence business behavior:
power distance, individualism vs.
collectivism, uncertainty avoidance,
masculinity vs. femininity, and longvs. short-term orientation.

Five cultural dimensions
The ﬁrst of Hofstede’s dimensions—
power distance—refers to the
distance in authority between
manager and subordinates. Business
cultures that have a high power
distance tend to be rule-driven and
hierarchical (everyone “knows their

Hofstede’s ﬁve cultural
traits can be measured
across companies in
different countries.
Hofstede’s research
allocated a score between
1 and 120 for each trait.
For example, companies
in China received the
highest score—118—for
long-term orientation,
while companies in the
USA had a much
shorter-term focus,
receiving a score of 25 (in

was unavailable).

place”). In Russia, for example,
employees have little access to
executives (power distance is high).
Conversely, in low power-distance
cultures, such as many companies
in Australia, decision making is
distributed more evenly throughout
the organization.
Anthropologists have long
theorized that collectivist cultures
control members through external
societal pressure (shame), whereas
individualistic cultures control their
members more through internal
pressure (guilt). In his second
dimension, Hofstede proposed that
this tendency toward collectivism
or individualism can be most
clearly seen in the difference
between Asian and US companies.
When problem-solving, US
businesses tend to look to the
individual for a solution, whereas
Asian companies prefer to pose
the problem to a group.

Masculinity and femininity,
Hofstede’s third cultural dimension,
are viewed differently from one
organization to another. Some place
great emphasis on masculine traits
(such as status, assertiveness, and
advancement), while others accord
feminine traits (such as humanism,
cooperation, collegiality, and
nurturance) greater value. Italian
organizations, for example, tend to
have assertive, competitive cultures.
The fourth of Hofstede’s
dimensions is known as
uncertainty avoidance. This is the
extent to which workers feel
threatened by ambiguous
situations. The more uncomfortable
people are with “not knowing” how
to react in a certain scenario, the
more rules and policies the
company will need to introduce to
reduce that uncertainty. Companies
with a low degree of uncertainty
avoidance are likely to thrive in

more uncertain and ambiguous
situations. British organizations, for
example, are considered fairly at
ease with unstructured and
unpredictable situations.
Hofstede’s ﬁfth dimension, longvs. short-term orientation, is the
extent to which organizations
privilege the short-term (proﬁt) over
the long-term (value generation). ❯❯

108 ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE
Japanese businesses, for example,
think very much in the long-term:
Toyota Motor Corporation has a
100-year business plan.

Why culture matters
Every organization’s culture has
varying degrees of these different
dimensions. The best leaders know
which cultures operate within
different parts of their organization
(and within different parts of the
world), and adjust their leadership
style to suit—valuing collective
approaches, for example, when
dealing with Asian subsidiaries.
Today, organizational culture is
more important than ever before.
Increasingly competitive markets,
globalization, the prevalence of
mergers, acquisitions, and alliances,
and new modes of working (such as
teleworking) require coordination
across vast numbers of staff and
huge geographic distances.
Hofstede’s observations highlight
the difﬁculties that leaders face in

maintaining uniﬁed business
cultures, whether operating across
multiple national or international
cultures. The challenge is to balance
the promotion of “one culture” within
an organization against the
inﬂuences of local cultures in
the external world.
Companies with strong
cultures, such as Nike and India’s
Tata Motors, are intensely aware of
their history and image. At Nike it
is not unusual for employees to
have the company’s “swoosh” logo
tattooed on their body. At these
businesses, culture encompasses
an internalized sense of “who we
are” and “what we stand for” to
such an extent that many of the
staff are able to recite corporate
maxims from memory. Similarly,
the UK smoothie company Innocent
has worked hard to create a
corporate culture based on
communication. Dan Germain, the
brand’s Head of Creative, explains:
“if people aren’t involved in all

decisions, big and small, then they
start to feel unloved and removed
from the business and its success.”

Cultural beneﬁts
Strong cultures give staff a sense
of belonging, which in turn brings
beneﬁts, such as job satisfaction and
staff retention. At Nike, staff are
considered rookies if they have been
at the company for less than a
decade. Moreover, culture deﬁnes
“the rules of the game,” simplifying
priorities. Decision making is faster
and easier if everyone understands
company values, beliefs, and vision.
Deeply embedded cultures also
improve the customer experience; if
staff believes in the product, they
will transfer this belief to customers.
Culture also protects an
organization from the whims of
charismatic leadership and the
ﬁckleness of fashion. A leader may
inﬂuence corporate culture, but a
successful culture should endure
even when management changes.

Features of culture

Visible aspects of culture, such as
an organization’s rituals, stories and
symbols, are only the tip of the iceberg.
Its beliefs, values, attitudes, and basic
assumptions are hidden but deﬁnitive.
Symbols
Ceremonies
Stories
Behaviors

Values
Assumptions

Feelings

Strong organizational cultures can
suffer from problems of groupthink
(everyone is too like-minded),
insularity (too narrow a vision), and
arrogance (a belief that everything
the company does is right). Culture
can become a source of power and
resistance; necessary change may
be resisted simply because “that’s
not the way we do things.”
Terrence Deal and Allan
Kennedy’s 1982 publication
Corporate Cultures outlined a range
of cultural phenomena. The authors
suggested that culture is composed
of a framework of six interlocking
elements: a company’s history; its
values and beliefs; its rituals and
ceremonies; its stories; the heroic
ﬁgures whose words and actions
embody corporate values; and the
cultural network.

great and allowed us to earn our
clients’ trust for 143 years ... I look
around today and see virtually no
trace of [that] culture.” The letter
made headlines, and the company’s
shares fell by 3.4 percent.

Culture in practice

The cultural network, devised by
Deal and Kennedy, refers to the informal
channels in a company—storytellers,
gossipers, and whisperers—through
which culture is formed and passed on.

Deal and Kennedy also deﬁned four
types of organizational culture,
which emerge from the interplay
between a company’s attitude to
risk, and the speed of feedback and
reward. In the tough-guy, “macho”
culture, rapid feedback and reward
are combined with a high tolerance
of risk, as in the advertising industry.
In the work-hard, play-hard culture
—such as a sales company—risk is
less prevalent, but rapid feedback
and reward produce a high-pressure
environment. In the “bet-yourcompany,” high-stakes culture, the
risk attached to decisions is high,
but feedback on success or failure is
slow. The oil industry is typical of the
high-stakes culture. In a process
culture, such as an insurance
company or government agency,
feedback is slow and risks are low.
Leadership and culture are
interwoven and interdependent. If a
leader does not protect or redeﬁne
the core values that made a
company successful, culture can
erode. In 2012, a Goldman Sachs
employee bemoaned the investment
bank’s “toxic culture” in an open
letter to The New York Times,
claiming: “the culture was the

The desire by leaders for some sort
of standardized culture—one that
is ﬁxed, visible, and stable—is
understandable, but it likely to
operate only in the imaginations of
leaders than in the experiences of
employees. Companies rarely have
one culture; they are usually a
combination of many, which
overlap across departments,
countries, and business units. The
task for leaders is to ensure that
these cultures do not diverge too
far from core organizational values.
Organizational culture is not
static. Every type of culture is
dynamic and shifts, incrementally
and constantly, in response to
internal and external pressure.
Managing culture, especially
through periods of deliberate
change, is one of the most difﬁcult
business tasks a leader can face.
The advice for leaders seeking
to change culture is start small.
Culture is slippery, and trying to
change everything at once often
results in failure. Bold new mission
statements, big ofﬁce redesigns, or
exhortations that “working here is
fun” rarely have the desired impact.
Cultural change requires long-term
investment in employees, not in
buildings and branding. This is
because culture may be led from
the top, but it grows from the
bottom; it requires patient nurturing
over time. Leaders must understand
the dynamic of an organization’s
culture so that they can usefully
draw on its strengths, rather than
be overcome by its constraints. ■

recognizing and understanding
other people’s emotions; and
managing relationships.
Goleman pinpoints high EQ as
a common trait among effective
business leaders. Without emotional
intelligence, he argues, a leader can
have limitless energy and ideas, a
perceptive and logical mind, and
impressive qualiﬁcations, but still be
ineffective and uninspiring.
Goleman cites Bob Mulholland,
head of client relations at Merrill
Lynch during the 9/11 attacks, as a
leader with high EQ. After his staff
saw a plane hit the twin building
opposite their own, they began to
panic—some ran from window to
window, and others were paralyzed
with fear. His ﬁrst response was to
“unfreeze” their panic by addressing
each of their concerns individually.
He then calmly told them that they
were all going to leave the building,
via the stairs, and that they all had
time to get out. He remained calm
and decisive, but did not minimize
people’s emotional responses. All
his staff escaped without injury.
This was a rare and unusual context,
but Mulholland’s approach shows
the value of EQ in managing staff
in any form of volatile situation.

Goleman suggests that high EQ

one to manage that feeling and any
behaviors that arise from it.

with age, experience, and selfreﬂectiveness—is just as important.
Today, the development of EQ
lies at the heart of leadership
coaching. New and aspiring leaders
are mentored by experienced ones;
together, they discuss past and
future scenarios, various possible
responses, and what the emotional

trigger points might be. This
procedure seeks to increase
emotional maturity. A 1999 study
showed that partners in a
multinational consulting company
who scored highly on EQ delivered
$1.2 million more proﬁt than other
partners. Other studies have shown
similar correlations between EQ
and effectiveness. Emotional
balance, it seems, is a key factor
in commercial success. ■

MEET
MINTZBERG’S MANAGEMENT ROLES
IN CONTEXT

Managers perform a multitude of roles,
which can be divided into three categories...

FOCUS
Management roles
KEY DATES
1949 French engineer and
business theorist Henri Fayol
develops what becomes
known as “the classical theory
of management.” This claims
that managers have ﬁve
key functions: planning,
organizing, coordinating,
commanding, and controlling.
1930s Australian psychologist
Elton Mayo publishes the
Hawthorne Studies, which
ushers in an era of peopleoriented management, rather
than managing according to
business objectives alone.
1973 In The Nature of
Managerial Work, Henry
Mintzberg dismisses Fayol’s
claims about the management
process as “folklore.”

...Informational:
Monitor
Disseminator
Spokesperson

...Interpersonal:
Figurehead
Leader
Liaison

...Decisional:
Entrepreneur
Disturbance
handler
Resource allocator
Negotiator

Management is a blend of these often conﬂicting
roles, where art, science, and craft meet.

T

he question “What do
managers do?” has vexed
experts, and many frontofﬁce staffs, since organizations
came into existence. In his 1975
paper “The Manager’s Job,” business
guru Henry Mintzberg argues that
managers are not the reﬂective,
systematic planners that people
assume; instead, “their activities are
characterized by brevity, variety, and

discontinuity.” He ﬁnds them to
be strongly oriented to action,
and disliking of reﬂection.
Mintzberg suggests that there
are ten basic management roles,
which fall into three categories:
informational roles (managing
through the use of information);
interpersonal (the management of
people); and decisional (managing
decisions and action).

164–65 ■ Crisis management 188–89 ■ Simplify processes 296–99 ■ Kaizen 302–09

The informational role is possible
because, although managers do
not know everything, they tend to
know more than their subordinates.
“Scanning the environment” and
processing information is a key part
of the manager’s job. In this sense,
Mintzberg claims, they are “the
nerve center of the organizational
unit.” They monitor what is going
on, disseminate it to others in
the companies, and act as a
spokesperson for the business
in the world at large.
Information is easily available
to the manager because the role
connects him or her to many
people. In this sense, the manager
plays an interpersonal role, which
also involves acting as a ﬁgurehead
for the companies, providing
leadership, and acting as a liaison
point between a large group of
people. The group may include
subordinates, clients, business
associates, suppliers and peers
(managers of similar organizations).
The third role of management,
is decision making. Managers must
oversee ﬁnancial, material, and

encourage innovation (act as an
entrepreneur); and seek conciliation
or paciﬁcation when the company
is unexpectedly upset or
transformed (be a “negotiator”
and “disturbance handler”).
None of these roles is exclusive
or privileged. Mintzberg claims that
effective managers shift seamlessly

Learning from failure

Organizational effectiveness
does not lie in that narrowminded concept called
rationality. It lies in the blend
of clearheaded logic and
powerful intuition.
Henry Mintzberg

Fact and ﬁction
The traditional view held that
management was a science, where
managers controlled a company’s
constituent parts—people and
machinery—both of which acted
in predictable and scientiﬁcally
controllable ways. Mintzberg
argues, however, that management
is a practice in which art, science,
and craft meet. It involves sorting
and processing of information,
organization of systems and,
most importantly, highly subjective,
nonscientiﬁc management of people.
Mintzberg is the author or coauthor of 15 books and more than
150 articles, and is best known for
his work on management and
managers. His Harvard Business
Review paper “The Manager’s
Job: Folklore and Fact” won a
McKinsey award in 1975. In 1997
he was made an Ofﬁcer of the
Order of Canada and of l’Ordre
national du Quebec; and in 2000
he was awarded Distinguished
Scholar of the Year by the
Academy of Management. In 2013,
he was awarded the ﬁrst honorary
degree ever given by the Institut
Mines-Télécom in France.

Mintzberg argues that the answer
to the question “what do managers
do?” is not simple. He concludes
that management is complex and
contradictory in its demands,
relying as much on intuition,
judgment, and intellectual agility
as on technical skill, planning,
and scientiﬁc logic. All these come
into play, he says, since a manager
designs, monitors, and develops the
ways in which things are done. ■
Although he has been teaching
since 1968, Mintzberg’s interest
in organizations and managers
emerged during his ﬁrst degree,
when he spent time at the
Canadian National Railway.
His memoirs describe the
catastrophic result of two
boxcars colliding as an excellent
metaphor for corporate mergers.

judgment” was outlined by US
psychologist Irving Janis in 1972,
and is known as “groupthink.”
Groupthink is the idea that
concurring with others is the sole
overriding priority. It can become
so strong that it precludes realistic
assessment and analysis. Insulated
from contrary perspectives, groups
displaying groupthink self-justify
their own conclusions. Irrational
decisions may be made based on
false or incomplete information.
Irving noted that groups
displayed a series of characteristics
when groupthink gains hold. The
group begins to feel invulnerable,
which encourages extreme risk
taking. It collectively rationalizes
decisions, fails to check the reality

of assumptions, and ignores
warnings. It begins to assume
a position of moral superiority,
and fails to consider the ethical
consequences of its actions.
The challenge for managers is
to recognize groupthink and take
action to prevent it. Encouraging
dissent, assembling groups with
diverse demographics, and listening
to others’ opinions before airing
their views are means of doing so. ■

MANAGING FINANCES

118 INTRODUCTION

F

inance has always been
seen as having two distinct
functions: recording
what has happened (ﬁnancial
accounting) and helping businesses
to make decisions about the future
(management accounting). Today,
it has a third function: ﬁnancial
strategy. This incorporates
judgments about risk, which some
companies (especially banks)
have realized must play a larger
part in ﬁnancial decision-making.

Understanding risk
Fundamental to an understanding
of ﬁnancial strategy are the
concepts of leverage and excess
risk. “Leverage” is a measurement
of the extent to which a business
is dependent upon borrowings.
The higher the leverage, the greater
the level of risk. In good times,
directors come under pressure to
produce impressive proﬁt growth,
and one easy way to achieve it
is to borrow money and invest
in the most proﬁtable parts of the
business. However, if the economy
turns downward, toward recession,
heavy borrowings turn into
an overwhelming burden.
Leverage becomes toxic.
The risk level generated
by leverage is worsened when
businesses use off-balance-sheet

ﬁnance, in other words, when
they do not report loss-making
investments on the company’s
balance sheet, thereby appearing
to boost proﬁts. This leads to an
important question in relation to
modern business: who bears the
risk? Traditionally it was assumed
that the risk taker was the
shareholder, because it is the
shareholders who collectively own
the business. However, in Europe
and the US especially, the desire
to encourage entrepreneurship has
led to generous rules that reduce the
extent to which losses are borne by
business owners. Since 2008, many
business collapses have proved
expensive for customers, staff,
and suppliers, but less so for the

The bonus mania which

business owners, particularly when
the failing institution has been a
bank. Some ﬁnancial commentators
wonder whether the balance has
swung too far away from tradition.

Director involvement
When times are tough, directors
have to make difﬁcult decisions
about investment and dividends.
Usually the directors will have an
agreed policy in place—perhaps
that half the after-tax proﬁt will be
paid as dividends to shareholders,
while the other half will be retained
to invest in future growth. But
during recessions it is wise to keep
more cash within the business, so
directors may decide that dividends
should be cut. If the business also
cuts its investment plans, it can
keep more cash in its current
account, providing the liquidity to
survive difﬁcult trading conditions.
So who is responsible when
things go wrong? This depends on
the systems of accountability and
governance within each company.
Ideally, the directors of the business
should be sufﬁciently involved to
know when things start to go wrong,
and call for discussion of a change
in strategy. If the directors are too
hands-off, they may feel unable
to hold the CEO fully accountable
when things do go wrong. Alert,

MAKING MONEY WORK 119

hands-on directors should also
spot when rewards for staff are
so out-of-control as to threaten the
proﬁts being made for shareholders
and for the future ﬁnancial health
of the business. “Proﬁt before
perks” should be the mindset.
Important to good governance
is a willingness to ignore the herd.
For example, if every US bank began
to expand into South America, a
smart South Korean bank would
refuse to copy. However, in practice,
this proves hard to do. Directors
meet each other in the same clubs
and conferences, and like to be part
of the same pack. Nevertheless,
US investment guru Warren Buffett
has become one of the world’s
wealthiest men by ignoring the
herd instinct among investors.

The mass market
Some modern boards of directors
accept that if there is wisdom
among crowds, there may be
even greater wisdom among staff.
Henry Ford was one of the ﬁrst
to realize that your workers are
your customers, but it has taken
a century for others to see the
potential in this phrase. Not only
is there value in drawing ideas from
staff who care about the products
they both produce and use, but
there is also strategic value in

understanding the huge potential
of the mass market. When looking
at China today, the most exciting
opportunities are for products that
would appeal to the hundreds of
millions of potential consumers
who are workers, not managers.

Using money wisely
In management accounting, two
factors are of particular importance:
cash and costs. A management
accountant works hard to provide
accurate data on production costs,
so that managers can make
informed decisions about pricing,
on outsourcing, and on which
products to back with marketing
spending. Activity-based costing,
which provides the most complete
data on costs per unit, is the best
way to do this. When trading
is poor, however, management
accountants place their tightest
focus not on costs but on cash
ﬂow, following the maxim that
“cash is king.” This arises because
the worse the trading conditions,
the more that companies try to hold
onto the cash they have—making
it much harder to get paid if they
are your customers. The ﬂow of
cash dries up, so an early focus on
cash ﬂow makes sense: start your
own cash hoard before others
begin trying to create their own.

For ﬁnancial accountants, the
traditional stance has long been
“playing by the rules.” Integrity and
adhering to accounting principles
such as prudence and consistency
were seen as most important. More
recently, career opportunities have
arisen for accountants who are
willing to be more creative. This
way of thinking stems from the
scope for “making money from
money,” by lending the company’s
cash deposits to other companies at
high rates of interest, or speculating
on future trends in exchange rates
or commodity markets. In a world
where a quicker, bigger buck can
be made from money than from
manufacturing, playing by the
rules may seem a poor choice. ■

there are intense pressures within
companies to push the stated proﬁt

though the underlying data that

for publicly traded companies to

Today, most countries around the
world follow the rules laid down by
the International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS). As a consequence,
the income statements and balance
sheets of companies in most
countries follow the same format. ❯❯

122 PLAY BY THE RULES
Mark-to-market accounting is a risky method of valuation, since it
values a company’s assets according to current market value. Historic
cost valuation is a more reliable, and cautious, measure of value.

During a stock-market
boom, valuing a company’s
assets and investments
according to their
current market value
can lead to an
overinﬂated
balance sheet.

Although the time frame for
implementation is unclear, a widely
supported plan is in place to merge
the IFRS with the US’s Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles
(GAAP) to provide globally
recognized accounting rules.
Although the rules are becoming
clearer, important areas for debate
remain. These might be raised
internally, in arguments between
company accountants and directors;
or the debate might be between
independent auditors and the
organization. When UK bank Halifax
Bank of Scotland (HBOS) collapsed
in 2008, the UK government bailed
it with $32 (£20) billion, before the
bank was acquired by Lloyds Bank.
In 2008 the gap between the bank’s
loans and its deposits was $341
(£213) billion. The bank’s auditor,
KPMG, was heavily criticized over
the HBOS collapse, although KPMG
had consistently raised warnings
over the risks involved. When the
UK’s regulator, the Financial
Services Authority, published a
report on HBOS in 2012 it noted
that KPMG had “consistently

position.

suggested that a more prudent
approach would be to increase the
level of provision” against bad debts.
Ultimately, the directors of HBOS
had decided to take an optimistic
view of the bank’s lending. They
chose to play beyond the rules.

Cautious accounting
Professor David Myddelton, a
UK management scholar, argues
strongly against the expansion

of rules in accounting. He believes
in traditional accounting principles,
because these supply the required
ﬂexibility for accountancy across
many different types of companies.
He claims that the idea that there
is a “single correct answer” when
preparing a company’s accounts is
nonsense. Nevertheless, this idea
lies behind the call for increased
regulation. “People want it to seem
as if we’re doing something about
scandals,” he says; they think that
greater regulation will make a
difference, “but it never does.”
Myddelton also believes that
directors should gain a “true and
fair view” of their accounts, instead
of being forced to rely on a picture
produced by someone else’s idea
of the accountancy rules.
Some “creative accountancy”
practices stretch the ﬂexibility
within the rules so far that they
can produce potentially misleading
accounts. “Mark to market”
accounting, for example, values
assets at their current market value.
This means that when the stock
market is booming, any investment
(such as shares in another business)
will also be booming. This boosts

ﬁnancial beneﬁts, particularly
in the long term.

sheet and may encourage it to
expand beyond its means. All it
takes is a fall in the stock market for
this valuable shareholding to
become worth considerably less.
Myddelton suggests that it is better
to use “historic cost” accounting
than “mark to market,” since this
provides a more stable set of ﬁgures;
it values assets at their cost at time
of purchase, minus any depreciation
that has taken place, rather than at
their current market value.
The argument of rigid rules
vs. looser-based principles will be
heard repeatedly when the merger
talks between the US’s rules-based
GAAP system and the IFRS
become serious. Even though the
IFRS is far more rule-based than
its predecessors, it retains a greater
reliance on principles than the
US’s GAAP system.

Ethical conduct
Whether rules based or rooted in
principles, no accounting methods
can prevent a deliberate attempt
by directors to mislead. In June
2012, for example, US constructionequipment giant Caterpillar Inc.
completed a $650-million purchase
of Chinese company ERA Mining
Machinery Ltd. and its wholly
owned subsidiary Zhengzhou
Siwei Mechanical and Electrical
Equipment Manufacturing Co.
This was part of Caterpillar’s
long-standing strategy of growth
in China. Unfortunately, a series of
black holes in Siwei’s accounts
soon emerged, including the
discovery in November 2012 that
the company did not hold the stock
levels it had claimed. In January

2013 Caterpillar said it was writing
off $580 million from the value of
ERA, thereby virtually admitting
that the purchase was a complete
waste of money. Caterpillar then
accused the previous management
at Siwei of deliberately creating
misleading accounts, but let the
matter drop in May 2013 when a
ﬁnancial settlement was reached.
In other circumstances, directors
can ﬁnd solace in the rules.
Operating in South Africa, Canada,
and Europe, short-term moneylender Wonga.com sets its annual
percentage rate (APR) on “payday
loans” as high as 5,800 percent.
This is perfectly legal because the

countries in which it operates have
no legislated cap on interest rates,
so the directors are playing by the
rules. However, a report by the UK
Citizens’ Advice Bureau in 2013
stated that three out of four “payday
loan” customers struggle to repay.
In contrast to the UK, countries
such as France and the US have
rules that set maximum interest
levels for consumer credit loans.
Ultimately, no set of rules can
substitute for ethical behavior
nor safeguard the system from a
determined attempt to manipulate
accounting ﬁgures in a misleading
way. In the hands of principled
accountants, ﬂexibility within the
rules is useful; but if someone seeks
to gain huge ﬁnancial advantage
no matter what, that ﬂexibility will
enable him or her to do so, even
if this entails acting immorally.
Rules help to ensure that
companies operate at an acceptable
minimum standard. The argument
revolves around where this standard
lies, balanced as it is between useful
standards and costly overregulation.
Rules also encourage those with
ethical principles to go further
than the minimum. ■

unusual for people to take advantage

mainly family companies—are the
dominant business model. A recent
study of the different performances

of family-owned and publicly owned
companies in Spain found that
family-owned companies performed
better, in terms of ﬁnancial equity,
than nonfamily companies of the
same size in the same industry.
Countries such as the UK and US,
however, have a larger proportion
of plcs than many other countries.
After decades of noninterference,
shareholders are once again
becoming interested in corporate
governance and gain. ■

Several companies have taken
positive steps to eliminate perks
as part of a cost-cutting strategy.

T-systems International, an ICT
subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom
AG, all workers must now ﬂy in
coach class, regardless of the
traveler’s position within the
company, or the distance and
duration of their journey. The
change from business- to
economy-class travel is thought
to have saved T-systems $1.5
million annually. Executives

were told that the choice was

expenses, or a cut in their
annual bonuses.
Since the 2008 ﬁnancial
downturn, there has been an
increase in the trend of
organizations tightening their
purse strings. Even the mighty
entertainment company Walt
Disney is phasing out executive
car allowances. Cost cutting and
eliminating perks puts greater
pressure on managers to boost

fter calculating the year’s
proﬁt, a company’s
directors can choose
whether to pay a dividend to
shareholders or reinvest the sum.
A dividend is the annual payment

to shareholders that most businesses
manage each year. It might amount
to a 3 percent return on the sum
invested, which would make it
comparable to the interest a saver
might receive from a bank deposit.

How much a company pays in dividends or
reinvests in the business is decided…

…according to growth prospects and the health
of the balance sheet.

When growth is high, or the
balance sheet is weak,
companies should retain cash
for reinvestment.

When the balance sheet is
strong, or growth is slowing,
companies should pay
dividends
to shareholders.

Directors must balance the need for reinvestment
in the business with shareholder returns.

The Dutch East India Company
was the ﬁrst public company to offer
shares. Investors put up money for
voyages in return for a share of the
proﬁts made from successful trips.

In 2012, for example, Honda Motor
Company of Japan paid out just
under half its $2.7 million proﬁt in
dividends, leaving just over half to
reinvest in the company.
The ﬁrst dividend payments
were made in the 17th century by
the Dutch East India Company,
which was the world’s ﬁrst company
to issue shares in exchange for
capital. To encourage investors to
buy shares, a promise of an annual
payment (called a dividend) was
made. Between 1600 and 1800 the
Dutch East India Company paid
annual dividends worth around 18
percent of the value of the shares.

Invest or pay out?
Dividend payouts are entirely the gift
of the directors. Their decision is
simple: what proportion of after-tax
proﬁt should be paid in dividends,
and what should be retained inside

the company for reinvestment? The
higher the company’s growth
prospects, the greater the incentive
to keep money within the business.
Slow-growing companies should
therefore pay out a high proportion
of proﬁts in dividends, whereas
booming organizations are more
likely to keep the cash within the
business. There is no safer source
of capital than retained proﬁt: it does
not need to be repaid, nor does it
require the payment of interest.
Another factor to consider is the
health of the company’s ﬁnances.
If they are weak, proﬁts should be
retained; only if the balance sheet
is strong should generous dividends
be paid to the shareholders.
Dividend payouts must be
considered carefully. In 2006, the
Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS)
declared a 25 percent increase in
dividends to shareholders. Market
commentators praised the move,
with one team of analysts issuing
the note: “Thanks Fred [Goodwin,
CEO of RBS], we love you.” The
dividend increase put money directly
into the hands of the shareholders.

in 2006 cost its shareholders dearly.

Making money from money is a risky,
short-term strategy.

S

ome companies opt to
“make money from money.”
This means they use their
cash assets not only to further the
development of their products, but
also to generate money through
the ﬁnancial markets. Some
companies believe that by making
hedges (bets) on the ﬂuctuations of
the currency markets, for example,

they can gain access to a new
source of proﬁt. The two terms that
exemplify the idea of making
money from money are “treasury
function” and ”shadow banks.”

Hedge betting
“Treasury function” is a term that
emerged in the late 1970s in the
wake of economic challenges, such

to rise, but in fact it underwent a
sharp devaluation and the company
ended up losing $2.5 billion.
As a result, some companies now
spell out their opposition to making
money from money. Mining
multinational Rio Tinto, for example,
stated in its 2013 annual report that
its treasury “operates as a service
to the businesses of the Rio Tinto
group and not as a proﬁt center.”

Shadow banks
Many manufacturing companies,
such as Brazilian paper company Aracruz
(known as Fibria since 2009), used the
treasury function to make money, not just
manage it, from the 1980s onward.

as quadrupled oil prices and
“stagﬂation” (where inﬂation and
unemployment are both high at the
same time). The idea emerged that
the goal of a company’s treasury
function (the department responsible
for stewarding its ﬁnances) should
be to achieve the optimum balance
between liquidity and income from
the company’s cash ﬂows.
During the decades leading up
to the 2007–08 ﬁnancial crisis,
large companies steadily added
greater responsibilities to the
treasury function. Often, these
began as ways to minimize risk,
but the opportunities for proﬁtable
trading became very tempting—to
the point that some companies took
out contracts on ﬁnancial hedges
that were worth more than all their
export earnings. For example, in
2008, the Brazilian paper and pulp
company Aracruz used cash assets
to make bets on currency futures
(the value of currencies at a future
date). Speciﬁcally, it bet that the
Brazilian currency would continue

Other companies, however, have
extended the treasury function to
become a major, or even majority,
proﬁt center for the business.
Companies such as US
conglomerate General Electric (GE)
have developed this function into
an effective “shadow bank.” In
2007, GE’s treasury function GE
Capital held over $550 billon of
assets, making it larger than some
of America’s top ten banks. It
contributed 55 percent of GE’s
proﬁts, mainly by borrowing money
short-term to lend to customers
over the long-term (“borrowing
short and lending long”). GE was
able to ﬂourish as a member of the
shadow banking system without
having to bear the regulatory
burdens of banks. By 2008,
however, it was forced to ask to
participate in the US government’s
banking sector bail-out program.
Making money from money
carries serious risks, whether the
bets go wrong or not. This is
because the more proﬁts a
company’s treasury generates, the
less willing the board may be to
invest in research and development
for the future growth of the company.
This way of making money from
money is strongly correlated with
short-termism in business. ■

Treasury in focus
For the decade prior to the
ﬁnancial crisis of 2007–08,
many companies began to use
short-term ﬁnancing to fund
long-term capital expenditure.
However, the ﬁnancial crisis of
2007–08 changed conditions
dramatically, as banks
collapsed or came close to
doing so. CEOs demanded to
know where their company’s
cash was, and the real-time
cash position. Not all
treasurers were able to
provide immediate answers,
since some of their
investments were in local,
manually operated, less-thantransparent systems.
As a result, the treasury
function has moved to the
forefront for many companies,
with an increased need for
transparency and up-to-theminute accountability. Boards
expect treasurers to be
prepared for the unexpected—
such as by increasing cash
reserves to reduce liquidity
risk. However, this brings up a
new problem for the treasury
function: if more cash is kept in
reserve, how can this surplus
liquidity be used most
effectively to fund growth?

The line separating
investment and speculation
is never bright and clear.

1981 Australian-born US

Drucker suggests that chief
executives “have not yet faced
up to the fact that they
represent power—and power
has to be accountable.”
1991 The Cadbury Committee
is established in the UK to
investigate scams, failures,
and accountability in corporate
governance. Its inﬂuential

Corporate Governance, is

ccountability is the
obligation of an individual
or organization to accept
responsibility (be accountable)
for their actions. In business,
it is often used to trace chains
of responsibility: staff may be
held to account for their actions
by those above them in the
organization’s hierarchy; or higher
tiers of management may be held
accountable for those below them.
Ultimately, the way the company is
governed is the responsibility of the
directors; their governance should
therefore be proactive and ethical.

Following a series of business
disasters (from Enron through to
Lehman Brothers and numerous

become a major issue worldwide.
To achieve effective accountability,
directors need to make sure that
roles and lines of authority are clear.
This makes it possible to trace the
cause of a mistake to its source—

governance to work well, board
members must be well-informed,

of the business and its owners—
the shareholders. Nonexecutive
directors have an important role
to play in corporate governance:
they are not company employees
and should be able to quiz
executives with impunity.

Board-level scrutiny
In 2011, consultants McKinsey &
Company published ﬁndings from
a survey of 1,597 board directors,
providing fascinating insights into
the proceedings of board meetings.
The survey showed that in Asia,
no more than a third of a board’s
meeting time was spent scrutinizing
management actions and decisions;
far longer was spent on strategic
planning. Although this sounded
sensible, it suggested that
accountability and governance
received less time. By contrast, in
North America nearly two-thirds of
board time was spent on scrutiny.
More surprisingly, the same
sample showed a lack of satisfaction
with fellow board members.
Directors thought that more than
30 percent of their peers had

limited or no understanding of the
risks their company faced. This
suggested a ﬂaw in the ability of the
board to hold executives to account.
Most of the time, in most
companies, executives make sound
decisions that require minimum
scrutiny. However, good governance
ensures that the board is always
alert—so it will be fully aware of
what is happening when a mistake
is made. Such a mistake might be
related to strategy (an overpriced
takeover bid, for example), or to
the ethics of a particular situation.
Independently minded nonexecutive
directors should be in a prime
position to question, for example,
whether the company is right to
be using very low-cost suppliers,
or whether a contract has been
won using questionable means.

When things go wrong
The importance of good governance
was made clear in the case of
Japan’s mighty Olympus camera
business in 2011. Newly appointed
Chief Executive Michael Woodford
found that a $1.7 billion cover-up
of losses had been made when
acquiring other companies. The
Olympus directors had hidden
these losses from the published
accounts and therefore from public
scrutiny. The board responded
by ﬁring Woodford. Only after a
successful campaign by Woodford
did the Japanese authorities charge
key Olympus directors with fraud.
Eventually the whole board
resigned. The case demonstrated
how ineffective Olympus’s
nonexecutive directors had been
in holding the board to account,
and how important good governance
and accountability are to the
well-being of every company. ■

Born on March 3, 1839 in
South Gujarat, India, Jamsetji
Tata might have appeared an
unlikely candidate to be the
founder of a business that
would grow to be one of the
largest conglomerates in the
world. Tata followed his
father—who had broken the
family tradition of being a
Brahmin priest—into business
at 14 and soon showed
potential, graduating from
Elphinstone College in
Mumbai in 1858. After
working for his father, Tata
took on his ﬁrst enterprise—a
cotton mill—in 1868. One of
his dreams was to found a
steelworks, and although this
business aim would not be
achieved in his lifetime, Tata
Iron and Steel Company was
set up in 1907 by his son
Dorabji. The steel industry
went on to be the foundation
for Tata Group’s global success.
One of Jamsetji Tata’s
overriding principles was
fairness, which permeated
his entire business approach.
In terms of accountability, his
vision was simple: “We started
on sound and straightforward
business principles, considering
the interests of the
shareholders as our own.”

ost economic models
state that during the
early stages of economic
development, low-wage workers
ﬁnd themselves making products
that are bought by middle- and
upper-class consumers. The
workers tend to eat simple food,
such as potatoes, rice, or corn,
and travel on foot or—if they are
lucky—use a bicycle as a means
of transportation. Meanwhile, their
employers eat expensive meatbased meals, and travel in
luxurious transportation—from
the ﬁne horse carriages of the 17th
century to the sleek, “dream
machine” automobiles of today.
However, economic growth
takes a huge step forward when
workers are able to buy the products
that they make; when they, too, can

some companies are able to remain

After leaving school, Ryan

and then a fashion wholesaler
in London before returning to
Dublin, where he worked for
retailer Dunnes Stores. In 1969,
Garﬁeld Weston, CEO of
Associated British Foods (ABF),
hired Ryan to set up a discount
clothing chain with a seed fund
of $80,000 (£50,000). The ﬁrst
store, Penneys, opened later that
year in Dublin, but Ryan changed

his engineers to start a special new
business division. This became the
nucleus of a new Semco, developing
new ideas that soon generated 66
percent of the company’s business.
Semler’s leadership approach
is to encourage his work force to
manage themselves in terms of
time-keeping, work-scheduling,
and career development. By doing
so, he believes that workers will
truly care about what they do; this
means that they will inevitably be

that results. This approach has

Markowitz advocates
gathering a portfolio of
investments to protect against
losses due to ﬁnancial risk.
1990s Research on types of
ﬁnancial risk identiﬁes ways
of measuring and managing
different kinds of risk, including
market risk (changes in the
value of equity, interest rates,
currency, and commodities)
and credit risk (the risk of
nonpayment of debts).
1999 UK conglomerate General
Electric Company (GEC) is
renamed Marconi plc, and its
traditional businesses are
sold off. The directors’ gamble
on this change in strategy
fails—the business collapses
in 2001 and shares are
suspended. Nearly 25 percent
of staff is laid off.

T

he degree of ﬁnancial risk
borne by a company has
profound implications for
the long-term viability and success
of the business, its employees,
and its shareholders. A business
structured in a traditional manner
would put the most risk on the
shareholders, since they stand
to lose their investment if the
venture fails. But the proliferation
of increasingly complex ﬁnancial
mechanisms and means of
accounting have, to a degree,
insulated a business’s owners from
the worst effects of failure.

When a business is
ﬁnanced with debt,
or with other people’s
money...

...a small investment
in shares can yield
control of the company.

...while the costs of
failure are largely borne
by the work force...

This increases
the chances of huge
proﬁts for the
business owners...

...and the company’s
middle managers, who
take the blame for
poor performance.

Heads I win;
tails you lose.

Greek shipping magnate Aristotle
Onassis built a business empire
that stretched across the world and
incorporated dozens of industries,
and was underpinned by complex
ﬁnancial arrangements. Onassis
recommended utilizing “other
people’s money,” and while this
approach might yield ﬁnancial
success, it may end with others
bearing the costs of failure.

Traditional risk
In theory, the risk takers in a market
economy are the shareholders, who
effectively “own” the business. The

shareholders’ capital ﬁnances the
business start-up, and remains at
risk until it is repaid in full. If the
business liquidates, the holder of
“ordinary” shares (as opposed to
“preferred” shares, which are higher
in ranking and yield dividends
before ordinary shares) is the last
in the line to be paid. The ordinary
shareholder is therefore the least
likely to recover his or her
investment. Because of the risks
they take, entrepreneurs are held in
high esteem. So are early-stage,
venture-capital investors, who invest
in start-ups in return for equity.

The burden of risk associated with a business is spread wider as its ﬁnancial
affairs grow more complex. Executives and staff stand to lose ﬁnancially and
perhaps even punitively—with prison sentences possible—if the company fails.
Creditors and shareholders can lose ﬁnancially, while in the worst-case scenario
taxpayers may bear the heaviest burden of all—in the form of high taxation and
low economic growth—if their government chooses to rescue the business.

Shareholders

Venture capitalists, such as Indianborn Vinod Khosla of Sun Microsystems,
invest in companies at an early stage
and risk bearing the brunt of failure.
But returns can be high with success.

The association of risk with the
shareholder is beneﬁcial in many
respects. A risk-bearing shareholder
in a large, multinational bank would
be inclined to discourage senior
management from taking large risks
with the bank’s capital or reputation.
Calculated risks may be considered,
but not risks that threaten the
existence of the business. The
shareholder can play a signiﬁcant
part in the business process, acting
as a natural check on the company’s
propensity to take risks. This view
of business has been held since the
foundations of modern capitalism
in the 18th century.

This protection is intended to allow
a company to rethink its business
plan and perhaps ﬁnd a more
proﬁtable business model.
In the UK, a struggling company
can choose to enter a phase of “prepack administration,” in which the

business’s assets are sold after it
has entered bankruptcy. The assets
and operating model are sold to
new owners, leaving the original
business entity behind. Suppliers
and other creditors may receive no
more than a token payment, such
as 10 percent of the value of their
claims on the business. The new
shareholders then have a debt-free

old company, but with none of the ❯❯

liabilities. This method can be
especially controversial, since it
can allow the owners of the original
business to sell the “pre-packaged”
new entity and still be involved in
the business. In August 2008 the
London-based restaurant business
of Michelin-starred chef Tom
Aikens went into administration.
It was bought by TA Holdco Ltd.,
of which Aikens was appointed
partner and shareholder. Around
160 suppliers were left nursing
losses that would never be
recovered. However, by early 2010
Tom Aikens’ business achieved a
ﬁnancial turnaround, and opened
three new ventures in London.
When pre-pack administration
is utilized, suppliers are revealed
to be in a much more vulnerable
position than might otherwise be
expected. The ﬁnancial losses
incurred by Aikens’s restaurants
were effectively absorbed by
suppliers, not shareholders. In a

Employees at risk
Staff employed by a business is
also at risk when a company fails.
When US energy company Enron
collapsed in 2001, an extraordinary
feature of the unfolding story was
the plight of many employees.
Unlike the senior executives, rankand-ﬁle staff had been part inspired
and part browbeaten into “showing

shares. When the business was
liquidated, employees not only lost
their jobs, but also their pensions.
When the collapse of the business
was becoming clear, Enron froze
its pension fund, preventing
employees switching their pension
holdings out of Enron shares.
Employees can also be
vulnerable due to the predations of
the investment market. If a company
is bought through private equity,
employees can ﬁnd themselves
worse off if the business fails. A
private-equity purchase is when a
publicly traded company is bought
by a “private-equity group,” often
through a leveraged buy out, where
the assets of the purchased
company are used as security to
borrow funds with which to ﬁnance
the purchase. In so doing, the burden
of risk is on the business (and its
employees), not on the owners.
The UK franchise of Canadian
underwear business La Senza
collapsed in 2012, with 1,100
employees losing jobs. In cases like
this, the staff has little to gain when
things go well, but everything to

are in the same position. Only the
private-equity shareholders are
protected—by limited liability.
When publicly traded soccer
team Manchester United was
purchased by US businessman
Malcolm Glazer and his family in
2005, the transaction was
effectively a private-equity deal.
The Glazers followed standard
practice, buying the publicly-listed
company for $ 1.3 billion, then put
the debts onto the balance sheet of
the new Manchester United Ltd.
Private-equity owners suggest that
debt is an effective means of forcing
employees to work efﬁciently to
make a proﬁt and meet interest
payments. More plausibly, though,
it is a way of transferring risk from
the private-equity owner to a limited
liability subsidiary. If Manchester
United Ltd. were to enter ﬁnancial
trouble, the liability of the Glazers
would be minimal due to the
protection of “limited liability,”
which limits the owners’ liability to
the value of their investment, not
the total debts of the business.
Research published in 2013
compared the performance of 105
companies purchased through
private equity and 105 “control”
companies in the same industries.

Charles Handy
UK management expert (1932–)

They were investigated over a tenyear period—the six years leading
up to the buy out, and the four
years after it. The researchers found
that in the year following the buy
out, 59 percent of the private-equity
owned businesses cut their stafﬁng
levels, compared with 32 percent in
the control group. In the following
years, private-equity ownership
was associated with falling average
wage levels among staff. In the
short term employees appear to
lose out—and in the medium to
long term their chances of losing
their jobs are higher due to the
greater level of debt of the
companies they work for.

Private-equity iniquity
Not everyone loses out under
private equity. In 2003 the British
retailer Debenhams was purchased
by three private-equity companies.
The businesses paid themselves
a dividend of $1.9 (£1.2) billion
before ﬂoating the publicly traded
Debenhams onto the stock market
in 2006—laden with debt. Years
later, in its 2012 annual accounts,
the ﬁnancial strain still showed.
The degree of “gearing” (debt as a
percentage of capital employed in
the business) at Debenhams was a
high 51.5 percent, and its liquidity
(as measured by the “acid test
ratio,” which determines whether a
company has enough short-term
assets to cover its immediate
liabilities) was a very weak 0.175.
Yet for the private-equity owners,
the deal was highly proﬁtable—
they made $1.9 (£1.2) billion very
quickly and still retained shares in
Debenhams (a stake that was sold
in the years that followed). Their
overall proﬁts exceeded 200 percent.
For the bosses of private-equity
companies, the rewards can also be
impressive. Bernard Schwarzman of

company Blackstone Group earns
$130 million a year. He is closely
followed by the bosses of Carlyle
Group, Apollo Global, and KKR—
who each earn in excess of $100
million a year. Remarkably, all these
bosses enjoy favorable tax treatment
in both the US and the UK. This
became an important issue in the
2012 US presidential election, when
Republican candidate Mitt Romney
(a former private-equity boss) had
to admit that his income tax rate, at
14 percent, was lower than that of
average, working Americans.

Executives on the hot seat
In the world of public limited
companies and corporations, the
CEO might be in the riskiest
position of all. They may have the
most to gain from their business’s
success, but also the most to lose
from its failure. These risks may be
partly ﬁnancial, but even more they
are reputational. Richard Fuld, chief
executive of Lehman Brothers at
the time of its 2008 bankruptcy,
went from being an award-winning
CEO to a nominee for a range of
“worst ever...” awards. From being a
director of the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York, he became a pariah. ❯❯

144 WHO BEARS THE RISK?
Italian food giant Parmalat’s 2004
$1.6-billion accounting cover-up was
primarily due to fraud. The effects were
sharply felt by shareholders and the
many employees who lost their jobs.

In the UK, a similar fate awaited
ﬁgures such as Fred Goodwin (CEO
of Royal Bank of Scotland when it
collapsed in 2008) and James Crosby
(CEO of Halifax Bank of Scotland
until 2006). Both were blamed for
the dramatic collapses of their
banks in 2008, and for their part in
the subsequent economic turmoil.
Is it fair that a company’s
bosses should have to take the
blame for failure so personally?
After all, it is inconceivable that the
CEO is the only one to blame for the
failure of a business. Objectively,
the answer is clear, because
business failure is certainly the
responsibility of more than just the
CEO. Yet high-proﬁle executives
often strive to associate themselves
so closely with the company—
making it seem as though they
personally are the business—and
are so eager to back this up with
massive remuneration packages,
that it can be no surprise when the
public and the media turn on them.

Taxpayers to the rescue
In mature, developed economies,
businesses are supposed to take
risks in pursuit of reward. Failure

should, on this basis, lead to the
death of the business. AustrianAmerican economist Joseph
Schumpeter, in his classic 1942
book Capitalism, Socialism, and
Democracy, made the famous
statement: “The process of Creative
Destruction is the essential fact
about capitalism.” Schumpeter, like
many others, viewed recessions as
a cleansing mechanism, allowing
the weak to fall back and new,
stronger companies to emerge.
Yet modern governments seem
to see things differently, certainly
in relation to large businesses. The

term “too big to fail” illustrates that
business risks have been transferred
to the taxpayer. Faced with the
bankruptcy of General Motors and
Chrysler in 2009, the US government
—in other words, US taxpayers—
took on billions of dollars’ of debt to
give the companies a fresh start.
In the UK and Europe, bank
bailouts in 2008 and 2009 saved
the private sector from huge losses.
In Europe, what was put forward as
a Eurozone government problem
was in fact a private-sector problem,
as banks faced nonrepayment of
loans to businesses within Greece,
Portugal, or Italy. The bailouts
were arranged and ﬁnanced by
governments, meaning that
taxpayers turned out to be the risk
takers, even though nobody asked
their opinion. American economist
Nouriel Roubini summed this up
by saying: “This is again a case
of privatizing the gains and
socializing the losses; a bailout
and socialism for the rich, the
well-connected, and Wall Street.”
This issue has stretched far
wider than the US and Europe,
inﬂuencing the economic situation
in both Japan and China in recent
decades. From the start of its
20-year depression in 1990, land
prices in Japan fell by more than 80
percent, and today remain far below
the levels reached in 1988 before the
recession began. In effect, almost
every bank in Japan was insolvent
as a result of vast portfolios of
nonperforming loans—loans that
were made to companies that could
neither repay the debt, nor pay the
interest on that debt. Only the
support of the Japanese central

MAKING MONEY WORK 145
bank kept these commercial banks
alive. The taxpayer took on the
risks that are supposed to be taken
by the private sector. Many
analysts suggest that the same is
true in China at present, although
the opacity of the Chinese banking
system makes this hard to verify.

Who bears the risk?
Roubini’s statement that losses
are “socialized” (borne by the public)
while proﬁts remain in the private
sector appears to be true. Income
inequality has widened considerably
around the world in recent decades,
in countries including the US,
UK, China, and India. For instance,
between 1979 and 2007 in the US,
the income of the top 1 percent of
earners rose by 266 percent, while
that of the bottom 20 percent rose

by only 37 percent. Government
bailouts for big business effectively
mean that taxpayers are providing
support for those who beneﬁt most
from today’s economic system. In
the long run, businesses may enjoy
substantial proﬁts, and accept the
rewards as recompense for the risks
they take. But if the risks (and losses)
are borne by the taxpayer, it is fair
to question why only shareholders
gain the proﬁts in the good times.
Often, employees and suppliers
bear higher levels of risk than
seems fair—shareholders, who
enjoy the rewards of success, should
bear the primary risk of failure.
Even trade-union protection for
workers has been eroded in recent
decades—in the US and many
countries around the world, unions
account for no more than 10 percent
of private-sector employees, which
leaves workers unprotected when
things go wrong. Although labor
ﬂexibility has its merits, imbalance
between “my risk” and “your
reward” has perhaps gone too far. ■

assets have dropped in value. They
often suffer serious losses. A
contrarian investor—or a savvy
company that holds a portfolio of
investments—does the opposite.
When share prices rise and new
investors are attracted into the
market, they sell, and if the market
slumps, they buy. However, few
investors show the foresight required
to know when a boom is turning to
bust. Warren Buffet, a legendary
investor, says: “We simply attempt
to be fearful when others are greedy
and to be greedy only when others
are fearful.” Between 1965 and 2013,
Buffet’s investment company gave
investors a capital gain of more

the herd came with the dot-com
bubble, between 1998 and 1999.
Among numerous examples of
extraordinary share-price gains
followed by equally huge losses,
was the business eToys.com,
which was opened in 1997. In May

piled in, pushing the price up to

giving the business a higher
market value than the retail giant
Toys R Us. As the market turned
downward, the experts started to

Global market shares of smartphones in 2009–13 varied
greatly: Apple stayed relatively stable; Nokia and RIM, who

then approached the owner of

implying that a mix of civilian
and military businesses was a
preferable focus. Could things
really have changed that much
between 2006 and 2013, or was
BAe responding to the trend for
diversiﬁcation? Strong business
leaders look to the long-term and
ignore fads and fashions among
stock-market analysts and
management consultants.

Following the leader

It makes sense for the share-buying
public not to follow mass trends,
but is the same true for business
leaders? In 2008, US mass-media
corporation AOL, noticing the
growth in social network sites,
bought the social-networking site
Bebo for $850 million. It joined the
herd and lost out badly. In 2013, it
sold the same business back to its
founders for $1 million.

Following trends
Business leaders, then, must be
as cautious as anyone else about
treading the same path as the
majority. There are three main
types of herd to ignore. The ﬁrst,
as mentioned, is the occasional
stampede to make takeover bids.
In this case, business leaders worry
that if they do not buy a rival,
someone else will and perhaps
create a bigger, more difﬁcult
competitor. At such times, there is
much talk of synergies (the sum
being worth more than the parts)

2011

but little mention of long-standing
research, which suggests that 60
to 66 percent of all takeovers
destroy shareholder value for the
winning company. In other words,
most takeover bids prove to be
a disappointment.
The second herd behavior to
ignore is the strategic clash between
focus and diversiﬁcation, and the
way the market tends to concentrate
on one of these two at any one time.
When “focus” is the market mantra,
share prices rise in companies that
sell off peripheral assets or divisions
of the business. This is what
happened to British Aerospace
(BAe) when it sold its 20 percent
stake in the Airbus aircraft business
in 2006. At the time, the stock
market liked its $2.99 (£1.87) billion
sale of the largely civilian aircraft
maker, since it focused BAe on the
defense and military sector. By 2013,
this view looked absurd, as Airbus
powered ahead but governments—
especially the US—cut back on

The third herd behavior to avoid
is “followership.” This occurs
when companies develop “me-too”
products to imitate market
innovators. Of course, if a business
already has a genuinely
differentiated offering, it is wise to
follow a new trend. Often, though,
businesses rush out copycat
products to demonstrate that they
are staying competitive in a sector.
When the iPhone was launched in
2007, Nokia could boast more than
40 percent of the global smartphone
market. Despite a series of new
product launches by the company,

its share of smartphone sales
collapsed to around 3 percent in the
ﬁrst quarter of 2013. Throughout this
period, Nokia was desperately trying
to catch up with Apple’s iPhone—
but doing no more than throwing
new products at the problem, instead
of taking a deep strategic breath
and deciding what innovations
might earn it a stake of the market.
The contrast between Nokia’s
behavior and that of Apple’s could
not be greater. In 2008 and 2009
the big trend in mobile computing
was away from laptops and toward

“netbooks.” In 2009, global netbook
sales rose by 72 percent. The herd
instinct of businesses such as Dell
was to produce their own netbook.
At Apple, by contrast, boss Steve
Jobs announced that “the problem
with netbooks is that they’re not
better than anything.” He worked
to develop a superior alternative to
netbooks—the iPad. By mid 2013
the iPad had sold more than 145
million units and the original
makers of netbooks (Taiwan’s Asus)
had halted production completely.
Those who ignore the herd can
apply cool logic to their situation
and think ahead to possible future
scenarios. The herd tends to think
that tomorrow will mean more and
more of today. Those who ignore
the herd can identify fundamentals
that persist over time, while looking
toward what might be different
tomorrow. As US entrepreneur Sam
Walton advised, it often makes
sense to “swim upstream.” ■
The success of the iPad reﬂected
Apple’s resolve to develop a superior
alternative to the “netbook.” Companies
like Apple and Samsung need to be
ahead of the herd, not behind it.

Warren Buffett
Generally considered the
most successful investor of the
20th century, Warren Edward
Buffett was born on August

demonstrated an early ability
with mathematics and was
able to add large columns
of numbers in his head. His
father was a stockbroker
and congressman.
Buffett began investing
at the age of 11. He started
several small businesses
while still a teenager, before
going to the universities of
Pennsylvania, Nebraska, and
Columbia to study business. In
1956 he formed the company
Buffett Partnership, where his
investment successes led to
his nickname, “the Oracle
of Omaha.” In 2006 he
announced that he would be
giving his entire fortune to
charity. In 2012 his net worth
was estimated at $44 billion.

indebtedness, or the extent to which
people or companies ﬁnance their
future by borrowing money. Society
and business had ignored the
warning of UK historian Thomas
Fuller: “debt is the worst poverty.”
When high leverage is
widespread in the economy—as
occurs when lots of people borrow
large amounts of money—the
degree of debt can create a shortterm boom. But this often comes
at the cost of a subsequent bust.

Taking risks
The ﬁnancial crisis of 2007–08 was
largely caused by high leverage.
Individuals borrowed large amounts
on credit cards and took out 100
percent mortgages, both against
inadequate levels of income. When
the debts could not be met and
house prices fell, huge numbers
of people defaulted on their debts.
The equally highly leveraged banks
stumbled; their problems were
made worse by the large-scale

use of complex ﬁnancial products
(also based around leveraging),
and the ﬁnancial system crashed.
Leverage carries similar risks
for businesses. During good times,
when demand is rising and proﬁt
margins are high, borrowing capital
to ﬁnance extra growth may seem
an attractive means to boost proﬁts.
But leaders often ignore the
increase in risk that accompanies
an increase in borrowings. Paying
back debt is not optional (unlike the
payment of dividends, for example).
Highly leveraged businesses can
suddenly ﬁnd that their high levels
of debt are no longer serviced by
sales. The borrowings that had
driven proﬁts can begin, instead,
to drive the company into severe
cash-ﬂow problems.
Broadly speaking, it is wise to
restrict borrowings to around 25
to 35 percent of the total long-term
capital employed in the business.
Any higher than 50 percent is
regarded as carrying too high a risk
level for a normal business. After
all, while the directors need to aim
for maximum proﬁts, they are also
responsible for the long-term health
of the business, together with
the welfare and security of staff,
customers, and suppliers. ■

The leveraged buy-out
In a leveraged buy-out, a
business is acquired by a
company or group of
individuals using a large
amount of borrowed money,
most often from bank loans or
bonds (interest-bearing loans
that are used to raise capital).
Typically, the buy-out may be
paid for with a ratio of around
90 percent debt to 10 percent
equity, and the assets for the
loans are those of the company
being acquired. In other words,
the theory is that the debt is
later repaid by money raised
from the acquired business.
Leveraged buy-out investment
companies are today known as
private-equity companies.
In the 1980s, leveraged
buy-outs became notorious,
as some acquirers used a
borrowing ratio level of 100
percent, and the interest
levels on debt repayment
were so large that cash ﬂows
crashed and companies went
bankrupt. More recently, a
$2.85 billion leveraged buy-out
and subsequent restructure
was used to rescue struggling
US ﬁlm-production giant
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM).

Leverage

A business receives a $24,000 order, and has to plough cash into
making the goods. By week six, $20,000 has been spent by the company;
the customer is invoiced, but is not required to pay until week 13. This

Money scams
US investment advisor and
ﬁnancier Bernard Madoff was
sentenced to 150 years in prison
in 2009 following a money
scam that is believed to have
led to about $18 billion of losses
to investors. Although hailed
as a distinguished and expert
ﬁnancier, capable of generating
very high returns for investors,
Madoff was in fact responsible
for running a “Ponzi scheme,” in
which cash from new investors
is used to pay generous returns
to earlier investors. The delight

of these early customers led
them to recommend the scheme,
which then continued to pay
earlier investors with the cash
put into the company by
subsequent investors.
This type of ﬁnancial pyramid
is able to stay aﬂoat as long
as sufﬁcient numbers of new
savers put cash into the scheme.
If the ﬂow of funds dries up,
the scheme collapses. Madoff’s
scam collapsed due to a loss of
investor conﬁdence following
the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis.

practices in big businesses.
2001 The spectacular collapse

such as off-balance-sheet
accounting are not just
obscure talking points.
2010 Lehman Brothers bank

2011 UK care provider
Southern Cross collapses due
to off-balance-sheet debts to

T

he balance sheet is a
snapshot of a company’s
assets and liabilities and
should show any ﬁnancial risks that
a company is facing. Yet in reality,
not all of the company’s liabilities
appear there. This means that when
calculating the debts of a business,
it may not be possible to account for
everything. This was the case when
Enron failed in 2001, and it was also
true for the Western retailers and
banks that struggled from 2007–08.
Operating off balance sheet
was at the heart of the 2011 scandal
at Japanese camera company
Olympus. To hide poor management
decisions, such as overpaying in
takeover bids, the board set up
unconsolidated subsidiaries to hold
the transactions that were causing
losses. As unconsolidated losses, the
ﬁgures did not have to appear in the
its annual accounts. Analysts and
auditors should have spotted that
something was wrong when proﬁts
appeared “healthy” while cash was
draining out of the business. But
nothing was spotted until new CEO
Michael Woodford blew the whistle.

Enron used off- balance-sheet
accounting to hide overvalued assets
in subsidiary businesses. Its ﬁnancial
records continued to look perfect even
as it spiraled toward bankruptcy.

Off-balance-sheet ﬁnance has been
increasingly used by governments
in recent decades. In China, the
National Audit Ofﬁce has warned
that local government may have as
much as three times its ofﬁcial debt
of $600 billion in off-balance-sheet
unofﬁcial debt. This will add
greatly to future interest charges—

China experiences a credit crunch
similar to that in the US and
Europe from 2007–08 onwards. ■

Business goals and risks
KEY DATES
1978 Legendary investor
Warren Buffett claims that ROE
is not likely to stray from a level
of 12 percent for very long.
1995: The Warren Buffett Way
by Robert Hagstrom introduces
the public to Buffett’s approach
to investment, including the
importance he places on ROE.
1997 The US’s S&P (Standard
and Poor) index of industrial
companies reveals an average
ROE of 22 percent.
2012 Among international
clothing retailers, ROE varies
from 40 percent at Gap and
39 percent at H&M, to -139
percent at American Apparel.
Based on its ROE alone,
American Apparel should no
longer exist in its current form.

M

any stockmarket analysts
regard “return on equity”
(ROE) as a vital measure
of business success. ROE measures
proﬁt as a percentage of the shareholder’s equity on the balance sheet.
This “equity” is comprised of share
capital (capital raised from selling
shares) and reserves (the company’s
accumulated, retained proﬁt).
ROE is affected by trading
conditions. Still recovering from
a tsunami and ﬂoods, Toyota
achieved an ROE of 3.9 percent in
2012. Rival General Motors (GM),
unaffected by the natural disasters,
managed 16.7 percent. Based on
its ROE, GM appeared to be four to
ﬁve times better at generating proﬁt
from shareholders’ investment.

A misleading measure
As an indicator of investment
potential, ROE can be problematic.
The percentage outcome is a
function of two things: how high
the proﬁt is, and how low the
shareholders’ equity is. Toyota
and GM both made a similar pretax
proﬁt in 2012, but the amount of

shareholders’ equity in the two
companies creates a misleading
picture. Toyota has a huge balance
sheet with high shareholder equity,
bolstered by decades of high proﬁts.
GM’s bankruptcy in 2009 had
wiped out its reserves, leaving it
with a small equity base. GM’s high
ROE was largely due to its collapse
and US government bailout.
In the 2000s, many banks cut
their balance sheets through “share
buybacks.” Cash was used to buy
shares back from shareholders,
reducing the equity at the bottom
of the formula. This increased the
ROE, but led to a risky capital
structure. By maximizing ROE,
the banks left too little cash to deal
with the 2007–08 ﬁnancial crash. ■
ROE is calculated by dividing proﬁt by
average shareholder equity. The higher
the ﬁgure, the more efﬁcient the company
is at generating shareholder returns.

At ﬁrst, private equity came
only from large investors
wanting long-term gains.

But in the 1980s, smaller
investors used leveraging
and debt to buy companies.

This type of private equity
requires high short-term
proﬁt (to service debts).

Long-term opportunities
are likely to be overlooked
in favor of short-term proﬁt.

S

ome economists believe
that “private equity” is
misnamed, since it is a
model based on debt, not equity
(the value of assets owned outright
by an individual or company).
Private equity involves “leveraging”
a balance sheet by loading debt onto
the business. This is similar to the
controversial practice of “leveraged
buy-outs” (LBO), in which a
company is acquired using a high
percentage of borrowed funds,
loading it with a high level of debt.
Such levels of debt pose
inherent risk, as US politician Jack
Reed highlighted. Pressure on
managers increases—good proﬁts
are necessary in order to minimize
interest charges on the company’s
debt. The theory is that this forces
managers to perform better, but
critics claim that a company run on
the private-equity model is likely to
maximize short-term proﬁt at the
cost of long-term business growth.

Less pressure, more focus

As the role of private
equity has grown, so
have the risks it poses.

To its supporters, the main strength
of the private-equity model is in
what it removes. First, it removes
the regular proﬁt pressure from
shareholders that is faced by bosses
of a publicly traded company. For

example, in 2012, the US
department-store chain JC Penney
was given a facelift and a new, more
upmarket strategy. A sharp
downturn in sales forced a quick
rethink, including ﬁring the
recently hired CEO. Short-term
underperformance is unacceptable
to a public company, and can even
attract the attention of private-equity
investors seeking new acquisitions.
The second strength of the
private-equity model is said to be
the focus it provides. The boards of
publicly traded companies often
direct a diverse range of businesses.
For example, in 2012, the Sumitomo
Corporation of Japan sold a 50
percent stake in its Jupiter Shopping
Channel subsidiary to US privateequity group Bain Capital. This
effectively separated Jupiter from
Sumitomo, ensuring that the
Jupiter directors could focus on just
one area of business. This enabled
them to play a more hands-on role in

decisions and strategy. In the long
term, there are two critical questions
about private equity: does it produce
a better proﬁt performance? And is
it better for the long-term success of
the business, taking into account
innovation, staff commitment, and
customer satisfaction?
In 2013, a combined study by
three UK universities found that a
company’s performance falls after
being subject to a private-equity
buyout, based on proﬁts and
employment levels. The research
showed that four years after a
private-equity purchase, revenue
per employee rose from $190,000 to
$252,000, while in a control group it
increased from $190,000 to $295,000.
However, other studies have
suggested the opposite—that
private equity boosts proﬁts—so the
research is inconclusive.
It might seem that when “private
equity” is used as a term to describe
debt-fueled growth, years of success
can be followed by spectacular
losses. However, the majority of
companies making private-equity
purchases are institutional
investors, who want to invest large
sums of money over long periods. ■

Alec Gores
Perhaps the richest privateequity businessman in the

and used the capital to start

may be relatively clear about
direct costs, but vague about
the overhead costs that should

The commercial consequence of
this is that a business may allocate
marketing spending to a product
that is not very proﬁtable. In the
long run, a business that makes
wrong decisions like this will
struggle to keep up with its rivals.

Activity-based accounting
Ideally, an accounting system
measures every aspect of every
transaction and decision related to
a particular product or service. The
most effective way of achieving this
is through activity-based costing.
Whereas traditional accounting
systems estimate the overheads
(perhaps by assuming that every
unit produced at a factory should
have the same share of the total
overhead bill), activity-based costing
is much more precise: it breaks
down the overhead costs to ﬁnd out
which activities create which costs.
This allows the company to realize

Frederick Winslow
Taylor

that the cost of making a chocolate
product, for example, is not “about
65 cents,” but exactly “59 cents.”
This level of accuracy tends
to be especially important when
considering nonstandard products,
such as the completion of a special
order of merchandise for the Brazil
Olympics in 2016. Activity-based
costing might show that the costs
associated with this special order
are higher than they would be for
standard products. This would help
the business to set the right prices
for the Olympic items.
To perform effective activitybased costing, a company needs
to: ﬁrst, identify all the direct and
indirect activities and resources;
second, determine the costs per
indirect activity; and third, identify
the “cost drivers” for each activity. A
cost driver is a factor that inﬂuences
or creates costs. For example, a
bank teller has many activities—
when measuring the cost driver
of an activity such as handling
incoming checks, the bank should
ﬁgure out how long the teller spends
on this task alone. From these three

I

n Lewis Carroll’s Alice in
Wonderland the Cheshire cat
tells Alice that if you don’t know
where you are going, “it doesn’t
matter which way you go.” This is
a trap that businesses must avoid—
the starting point for any new
venture is having a goal and there
must be a clear strategy as to how
to get there. It is also essential to
have a vision of what success will be
like once that goal has been reached.
This vision must be shared and
understood by everyone so that the
company has a common objective.

Following a vision
Making decisions about a good
business strategy starts with critical
analysis, such as SWOT analysis,

Determine that the thing
can and shall be done,
and then we shall
ﬁnd the way.
Abraham Lincoln
US former president (1809–65)

but it should also involve identifying
which actions not to take. Strategy
is also vital for companies who
want to lead the market—most do
so by offering a product or service
that is either the cheapest or the
best. There are numerous business
models and theories that can be
followed to devise a successful
strategy. Leading US strategist
Michael Porter, for example, has
provided organizations with ideas
to help them analyze their market,
understand the competitive forces
at play, and position themselves for
competitive advantage.
Once the board of a company has
agreed a strategic direction, it must
be prepared to change course if the
need arises—but always keeping
the original vision in mind. In
addition, business leaders should
be on continual alert for changes in
the external environment. Avoiding
complacency is crucial, since the
pace of business and change is
constantly increasing. Competition
is ﬁerce, and companies must
innovate if they want to stay at the
top and avoid being overtaken or
becoming outdated. There are
many examples of companies who
failured to do this, such as Research
in Motion (now known as BlackBerry
Ltd), the Canadian technology
company whose business suffered

when sales of its BlackBerry
smartphones fell sharply—bosses
had failed to anticipate Apple’s
more advanced iPhone.

Keeping a balance
Companies should always balance
long- and short-term objectives.
The board must keep the long-term
vision in sight, but in the short term
they need to make decisions that
allow them to create enough proﬁt
to stay in business—a precarious
balancing act, particularly in an
uncertain world. It is impossible
to predict what the future will
bring, so executives often use
scenario planning by asking
“what if?” questions. Assessing the
likelihood of unwanted events does
not remove uncertainty, but it does
help to avoid complete surprises.
The trend of diversiﬁcation into
unrelated businesses has declined
recently, and companies now focus
on the core business. Management
experts C. K. Prahalad and Gary
Hamel argued that a company’s
ability to consolidate its strengths
into core competencies can provide
a competitive edge over rivals.

Flexibility
Globalization, technology, and a
changing world order have made
business far more complex.

WORKING WITH A VISION 163

Hierarchical structures tend to
be inﬂexible, so the emphasis
today is on nonhierarchical
structures, empowering people,
and teamwork. Flexible businesses
ensure that everyone is involved
and can adapt swiftly to change.
Such organizations collaborate
with external partners, rather than
merely transact with them, thus
encouraging shared learning. US
scholar Peter Senge introduced
the concept of the “Learning
Organization,” whereby a company
facilitates the learning of its
employees and is able to transform
itself on a continual basis. Control
by management is replaced by
leadership and direction.
Organizations with a learning
culture and a shared vision enable
people with different functions to
work together to develop ideas,
make decisions, and create new
products and services more quickly.
Staff act as a group of entrepreneurs
rather than as paid employees. Being
able to learn from failure requires a
culture in which people are not
criticized for mistakes, since this
impairs initiative and new ideas.
Companies have to learn not
just to deal with chaos but to
thrive. In the ever-changing
environment of the 21st-century’s
digital economy, companies have

to manage chaos and use it as an
opportunity to grow and refresh
the business.

Business today
Business may be complex in the
modern world, but it has never
been more interesting or exciting.
Physical size no longer equates
with success. The Internet changed
everything—now small can be
beautiful. Businesses that spring
up offering customized products
in niche markets are often able to
compete effectively in the global
economy. Some of today’s most
successful businesses started with
just one person, often in a garage

got to be a vision you
articulate clearly and forcefully
on every occasion. You can’t

or at a kitchen table. The important
thing is that companies should not
only offer what people want, but
also make it easy for consumers
to reach them online.
In addition to this is the overall
importance of ethics. “Proﬁt at any
cost” is no longer an acceptable
maxim. There is growing regulation
on ﬁnancial reporting and on issues
such as bribery. Today’s consumers
are increasingly demanding and
discerning: they want to know
how raw materials are sourced,
how products are made, and how
the company impacts the
environment. Some companies
have policies and procedures in
place to help create an ethical
culture. In this way, employees
know what standards are expected.
And yet there are still numerous
cases of corporate tax avoidance,
price-ﬁxing through collusion, and
excessive risk taking. These issues
persist because individuals are
often motivated by personal gain.
High-proﬁle cases include the 2008
collapse of the US ﬁnancial-services
organization Lehman Brothers early
in the global economic crisis.
However, many of the examples
in this chapter suggest that
companies who hold a clear vision
and do the right thing, in the right
way, are most likely to succeed. ■

to “turn every disaster into an
opportunity.” As the world turned
to electric lighting from kerosene oil
lamps, his business was threatened.
However, he quickly saw the
potential of Ford’s automobile and
realized that oil could just as easily
be converted to gasoline as
kerosene. His fortune rocketed.

Constant learning
Personal experience is recognized
as the way individuals learn, and it
is much the same for organizations;
they gain knowledge and capability
from corporate experience. The
pace of change in the global market
means that constant improvement
has become the norm. The greatest
challenge, however, is for
companies to recognize failure and
learn from it. In order to do this, an
organization needs to build a
culture in which people are not
criticized or penalized for mistakes,
but are actively encouraged to gain
useful insights from them.
Some companies recognize that
it is only through failure that
success can be found, and build

this principle into their culture. US
corporation 3M, for example, allows
technical staff to allocate 15 percent
of their time to experimenting with
ideas, understanding that there will
be occasional winners (such as the
Post-it Note) along with the
repeated failures.
Recognizing error, cutting
losses, spotting new opportunities,
and changing course is a test of
leadership and also sends out a
positive message to those who
work in the organization. It requires
rational, unemotional thought that
focuses on the costs and beneﬁts
of changing direction.
In the mid-1980s, the Coca-Cola
Company decided to replace its
original formula with a sweeter
product: New Coke. In the US, this
prompted consumer protests. The
company learned that US consumers
were protective of Coca-Cola and
felt unhappy about any tampering
with the recipe. The CEO quickly
reintroduced the original formula as
Coke Classic. By responding quickly,
he grasped an opportunity for
signiﬁcant publicity; sales soared.

The world’s third-largest retailer,
Tesco, opened its Fresh & Easy
stores in the US in 2007. After six
years and $2.27 billion in costs,
it admitted failure and pulled out.
The stores were unsuccessful
because Tesco misjudged the
shopping habits of its target
customers. Chairman Richard
Broadbent said they had learned
the value of remaining openminded about projects. Flexibility,
feedback, and fast response are key
to ﬁnding a new path via failure. ■

John Davidson Rockefeller was
born in 1839 in Richford, NY.
At age 16, he took a job as an
assistant bookkeeper with a
commission-merchants business.
Just four years later, he set up
his own, similar company with
a partner: it grossed $450,000
in the ﬁrst year. He then opened
his ﬁrst oil reﬁnery in 1863,
founding Standard Oil.
Rockefeller’s business interests
made him the richest person in
the world at the time, but his
practices were unpopular.
Realizing the value of effective
distribution, he arranged an

exclusive deal with the railroad
company to transport his oil,
putting all his competitors out
of business. Standard Oil gained
a monopoly position ﬁrst in
Cleveland and then in the US.
In 1902 his monopoly in reﬁning,
transporting, and marketing oil
made headline news and the
company was broken up by the
US Supreme Court in 1911.
Rockefeller then became the
world’s greatest philanthropist,
giving away around $350
million, and setting up many
charitable institutes. He died
in 1937, at 97 years old.

continued to dominate the market.
The knowledge he had gained
enabled him to improve his waterpowered spinning frame.

Moving ahead
Henry Ford did not invent the
automobile, but he did develop the
ﬁrst affordable car for middle-class
Americans at the beginning of the
20th century. Most people had never
aspired to owning a car because
they were seen as a luxury item for
the wealthy, and, as Ford said at
the time, most people would have
been happier with “a faster horse.”
Ford, like Arkwright, succeeded
because of a technical edge. His
idea was that of mass production,

using a moving assembly line to
reduce production costs. By 1918,
Ford Motor Company was the clear
leader in the US automobile market
—the Model T made up half of all
cars in the US. Ford continued to
lead the market until the mid-1930s.
Moving ahead of others in a
market involves risk. By taking the
initiative—with an innovative
product, new technology, lower
prices, better distribution,
promotional offers, or forceful
advertising campaigns—a company
creates an opportunity to seize the
leadership position. Organizations
may seek such an advantage
because their strategy and
approach is always to lead into ❯❯

Henry Ford was born in
Michigan, US, in 1863. He was
always fascinated by
machines, and as a child built
rudimentary steam engines.
He left school at 15 to work on
his father’s farm, but in 1879
he moved to Detroit to work as
an apprentice at the Michigan
Car Company, which made
railroad cars. He moved home
for a while, and did several
engineering jobs, before
returning to Detroit to work as
an engineer for the Edison
Illuminating Company.
At the same time, Ford
began to make a gasolinedriven car, Thin Lizzie, in his
garden shed. He persuaded a
group of businessmen to back
him, but a lack of experience
led to business failure—twice.
His third business—the Ford
Motor Company—was formed
in 1903. Its ﬁrst car, the Model
A, was followed by several
other models until the
company struck gold with the
Model T: “a motorcar for the
multitude.” By 1925 Ford was
producing 10,000 cars every 24
hours, producing 60 percent of
the US’s total output of cars.
His last great innovation—at
the age of 69—was the V8
engine. He died in 1947.

168 LEADING THE MARKET
Yarn spinning was the ﬁrst activity to
become entirely mechanized. The British
government restricted export of this
technology, maintaining its ﬁrst-mover
advantage for as long as possible.

a new market, such as Gillette, the
men’s grooming business, with its
long-held policy to be the “ﬁrst to
get it right.” Some companies
choose not to do this; Samsung, for
example, aims to be a fast follower,
having learned from competitors.

First-mover advantage
Being ﬁrst to market gives a
company “ﬁrst-mover advantage,”
which can be long-lasting or
short-lived. Long-term advantage
brings durable beneﬁts, either by
creating an entirely new market,
or by improving a company’s
market share over a long period.
Companies that succeed in
building long-term advantage
often dominate their product
categories for many years. Hoover
and Post-it Notes, for example,
were so successful in their market
sectors that their brand names
have become generic terms.
Short-term advantage typically
occurs because it is based on new
technology. Today, innovation is
exceptionally fast in many sectors,
with increasingly shorter gaps
between new introductions and

superior products. Sony is one
example of a technology company
that led the market for around 20
years, until competition from new
technology arrived.
Sony’s corporate philosophy is
built on “doing things that no one
else is willing to do.” The business
was set up in the ruins of Tokyo
after World War II, and the founder
Ibuka Masaru was determined to
develop leading-edge products and
get them to market faster than the
competition. This idea became a
personal obsession for Ibuka and
his successor, Morita Akio.

In 1979 Sony introduced the Sony
Walkman, the ﬁrst portable musiclistening device. Just as Ford had
changed the way people traveled,
Sony changed music-listening
habits—and lifestyles. Its launch
coincided with the aerobics craze,
and millions used the Walkman
to add music to their exercise
workouts. Between 1987 and 1997,
the height of the Walkman’s
popularity, the number of people
starting to walk as exercise
increased by 30 percent, according
to Time magazine. Sony sold 200
million of their portable cassette
players, and by 1986 the word
“Walkman” had entered the Oxford
English Dictionary.
The Walkman evolved from
cassette to CD technology, and
consumers were happy with their
portable music players until 2001,
when Apple CEO Steve Jobs said:
“The coolest thing about the iPod
is that your whole music library ﬁts
in your pocket.” So began a new
industry, based on portable digital
music, and dominated by marketleader Apple.

Being ﬁrst is everything

It’s not the consumers’
job to know what
they want.
Steve Jobs
US former CEO of Apple (1955–2011)

Leading the way often depends
on the product being embraced by
“early adopters”—consumers who
are willing to pay a price premium
to be the ﬁrst to own something.
This happened with the launch of
Apple’s iPhone in the summer of
2007. Even though the price was
reduced a few months after launch,
those who had bought at the higher
launch price did not resent it due to
the cachet of being at the forefront
of the latest trends and fashion.

WORKING WITH A VISION 169
As long as products remain the only
one of their kind available, the
company that is ﬁrst to market has a
monopoly position; this means it can
set the price, establish loyalty, and
build a reputation before competitors
catch up. When competition does
arrive, the ﬁrst-mover still has the
advantage, because it has
established itself. This is generally
the case even when subsequent
products are better than the ﬁrst.

It’s all in the mind
Al Ries and Jack Trout, authors of
The 22 Immutable Laws of
Marketing, developed a theory of
why the ﬁrst company to market
can continue to dominate. They
proposed that the customer’s
perception of where a product or
service sits in the market is of
utmost importance, claiming that
“it is better to be ﬁrst than it is to
be better.” It is easier to get into the
consumers’ minds ﬁrst than to
dislodge a product or service from
their minds and convince them that
your company has a better product.
Ries and Trout argued that most
marketing stems from the
assumption that companies are

ﬁghting a product battle rooted in
reality. But consumers are not
concerned with reality; they make
purchases based on perception.
“Being ﬁrst in the mind is everything
in marketing. Being ﬁrst into the
marketplace is important only to the
extent that it allows you to get into
the mind ﬁrst,” say Ries and Trout.

The car in front
Japanese car manufacturer Toyota
tries to be ﬁrst to market, and
imparts this message in the minds
of consumers with the slogan: “The
car in front is a Toyota.” Toyota was
the ﬁrst company to introduce a
hybrid car—with an engine drawing
power from both gas and electricity
—to market. Its Prius went on
sale in Japan in 1997. Several
manufacturers were considering
the concept of a hybrid car in the
1980s, but combining an internal
combustion engine and an electric
motor required signiﬁcant
investment. Despite this, Toyota
knew that if they could lead the
way, there would be a number of
advantages for the company. First,
Toyota would gain early-adopter
consumers who were looking for

an environmentally friendly driving
option. Second, creating a hybrid car
would increase access to new and
existing markets, such as the US,
where emissions legislation would
favor a hybrid car. Third, it would
enhance Toyota’s image, because of
its clear message of the company’s
commitment to environmental
protection, while at the same time
generating excitement about
Toyota’s new products and the
company‘s innovative capabilities.
The Prius went on sale
worldwide in 2001, and more than
ten years later Toyota continued
to lead the hybrid market. The Prius
was the top-selling car in California
in 2012, giving Toyota a 21.1
percent market share, compared to
closest rival Honda’s 12.5 percent.
Although other companies, such
as Ford and Nissan, have now
developed their own hybrid models,
Toyota’s ﬁrst move into the market
continues to yield beneﬁts in an
ever-growing market. ■
The Prius gas-electric hybrid has won a
sizable share of the low-emissions market
for Toyota. The company was willing to
invest signiﬁcant development funds in
return for a market-leading position.

The core business is the “main

remember that “the main thing is

Brigadier General Gary Huffman
of the US Army. When a company

is struggling to win sales for its
core product, it may be tempting
to consider diversifying, but this
often ends up being a distraction.
During the second half of the
20th century, there was a trend
for companies to acquire unrelated
businesses. Gillette, a leader in
razors, bought PaperMate pens;
Dalgety, which made Homepride
Flour, acquired a pig-breeding
company; and Cadbury, best known
for candy, took control of Schweppes
beverage business. The trend began
to turn in 2003, when McDonald’s
began to sell off diverse restaurant
chains it had acquired, including
a pizza brand purchased during the
1990s. This was because it wanted
to focus on its core business:
McDonald’s. Other companies
soon began to divest unrelated
businesses to protect the core.

Understanding the core
The theory behind selling secondary
interests is that the business should
focus its energy and resources on
what it is good at. This idea was
taken further during the 1990s, when

some companies decided to
“outsource”—contracting a business
activity to an outside company—
peripheral activities that they had
previously performed internally.
The trend of outsourcing gathered
momentum as companies realized
they could cut their business back
to the core and achieve leaner, more
efﬁcient, cost-effective operations.
For example, a company that
manufactures refrigerators may
decide that its core business is
simply the design, manufacture,
and marketing of those refrigerators.
It might outsource delivery (which it
sees as not adding value), and its
information technology (IT) needs
(which it views as a specialized
function). In the short term, handing
over these activities to a third party
would seem to make sense. But in
the long term, it could be a mistake.
Delivery might be an important part
of customers’ perceptions of the
product, and the business could
suffer if the outsourced delivery
company is unreliable. Similarly,
IT is increasingly integral to the
success of a business, both for

internal functions and customer
interaction. Outsourcing is useful
for lesser functions, but only as long
as it works well—if it fails, it can
adversely affect the core business.
Whenever companies outsource
or acquire a separate business to
take over a peripheral function, it is
vital that management take steps
to protect the “main thing.” Any
secondary units or third parties
must be fully aligned with the vision
and values of the organization. ■

Core competencies

If you cannot be the best
in the world at your core
business, then your core
business absolutely
cannot form the basis
of a great company.
Jim Collins
US business expert (1958–)

An organization has a particular
set of diverse production skills
and individual technologies.
These are its core competencies,
according to business experts
C. K. Prahalad and Gary Hamel.
Unlike physical assets, which
inevitably deteriorate over
time, competencies become
enhanced, because they are
applied and shared. They are
strengthened by involvement,
communication, and a shared
commitment to working across
an organization’s boundaries.

Prahalad and Hamel describe
the corporation as a tree.
Its roots are its unique
competencies, and from these
roots grow the organization’s
core products, which in turn
nourish separate business units.
From these business units come
the end products. The idea of
core competencies can be used
to identify those things within
an organization that are not
“at the core,” which might be
a distraction, consuming a
company’s valuable resources.

Larry Page

W

hen British computer
scientist Tim BernersLee harnessed the
Internet to develop the World Wide
Web, he was simply creating a
way of sharing information. It was
not viewed as a money-making
exercise. However, the Internet’s
disruptive power soon became clear:
it would change business and our
way of life, enabling commerce to
be conducted by a profusion of
individuals and organizations.
Early search engines were
invented as an increasing amount
of information became available on
the web. Larry Page and Sergey
Brin, two US computer science
students, designed a search engine
that could quickly search all the
available documents and generate
highly relevant results. In
September 1998 they set up a
work space in a friend’s garage and
opened a bank account in the name
of Google Inc. The soon-to-be giant
company began, as Page said, with
no more than “a computer and a
part-time person.”
Within a year Google had 40
employees, and in June 2000
announced its ﬁrst billion-URL
index, making it ofﬁcially the

world’s largest search engine.
By 2013, Google employed 30,000
people worldwide, of whom around
53 percent worked in research and
development, which may explain
the company’s phenomenal growth.

Born in 1973 in Michigan,
Lawrence (Larry) Page was
exposed to computer technology
at an early age; his father was a
pioneer in computer science and
his mother taught computer
programming. Page studied
engineering at the University of
Michigan and then completed a
Masters in computer engineering
at Stanford University.
On his ﬁrst visit to the campus,
Page was shown around by fellow
postgraduate student Sergey Brin,
who would later be the co-founder
of Google. During a research
project in 1997, Page and Brin

created a search engine called
BackRub, which operated on
Stanford servers until it outgrew
their capacity. The pair worked
together on a bigger and better
version, which they named
Google after the mathematical
term “Googol”—the number 1
followed by 100 zeros. Page and
Brin were jointly awarded the
Marconi Prize in 2004, and Page
was elected to the US National
Academy of Engineering in
2004. Today Google is the
world’s most popular search
engine, handling more than 5
billion search queries every day.

Doing business on the web
As two-way communication over
the Internet became a reality
during the 1990s, organizations
began to see the potential offered
by the new e-commerce platform.
The ﬁrst books were sold online
in 1992, and in 1994 Pizza Hut in
Santa Cruz, California enabled
people to order a pizza delivery
via the Internet.
The idea of online selling took off
in 1995 when Jeff Bezos dispatched
the ﬁrst book sold by Amazon.com,
then located in his Seattle garage.
Around the same time, software
programmer Pierre Omidyar was
starting a simple website called
AuctionWeb from his San Jose
living room. The ﬁrst product he
posted for sale was a broken laser
pointer. It sold for $14.83. Omidyar
recognized the Internet’s power to
reach individual customers,
anywhere in the world, when he

Starting small
Both eBay and Amazon started
small, and their platforms have
empowered countless other small
businesses around the world. Their
pioneering use of the Internet
changed the way that businesses
and consumers interact, putting
buyers and sellers in touch with
one another in a way that had not
been possible before. Amazon and
eBay demonstrate the power of the
idea that “small is beautiful.”
Anyone can sell products from their
platforms, from individuals selling
unique items to “power sellers”
who set up virtual stores, either
within the platform or linked to it.
In the online marketplace the same
opportunities exist for every
business, whether large or small.

Before the existence of the Internet,
if someone wanted to sell their
products, a physical presence was
necessary: a store, market stall, or
going door-to-door. Generally, the
bigger the presence, the more
successful the business. Success ❯❯

In the pre-Internet age, vast numbers
of people were often necessary for

of computing and the Internet changed
organizational structures forever.

In the digital, networked economy,
people can work anywhere, at any
time. This shift in working habits
is changing the face of business
environments and staff distribution.

purchase; cost and speed of delivery
are critical too. Free shipping and
free returns are attractive incentives
to purchase. Time of delivery is also
important: retailers who can offer
one-hour time slots and deliver
beyond the traditional working day
gain a competitive edge. Customer
service is more important than ever.

Feedback is king
in retail, for example, traditionally
relied on a prominent store on a
town’s main street, where the
retailer could attract the largest
number of customers through the
door. Companies often depended
on a large sales force, who visited
customers to build relationships.
Businesses held signiﬁcant
amounts of stock in warehouses,
and had a large ofﬁce staff to take
phone calls and handle paperwork.
That has all changed.
Consumers can now ﬁnd retailers
large or small via the Internet from a
laptop, smartphone, or tablet. The
physical scale of a business no longer
correlates with success. Many
businesses no longer need large
ofﬁces. Paperwork has diminished,
while online communication—email,
instant messaging, and social media
—allows sole-traders and employed
people alike to work remotely, from
home, anywhere in the world.
Large companies used to be
more competitive than small
companies because they had better
economies of scale (the cost
advantages that enterprises obtain
due to size). When computers were
ﬁrst developed, this continued to be
true, because large, costly servers
were required for ﬁle storage.

Today, however, the Internet is free
and technology prices are relatively
inexpensive. Cloud computing—
whereby organizations share virtual
infrastructure, software, and
storage —has enabled small
businesses to have access to the
power of integrated networks and
computing at a very low cost, and
with no use of physical space.
Just as scale is no barrier to
success, neither is geography.
A small business can now reach
customers all over the world just
as effectively as a large one. It is
possible to live on one side of the
globe and sell items from an entirely
different continent. The introduction
of PayPal in 2000 allowed simple
payment and money transfers in a
wide range of currencies via the
Internet, furthering opportunities
for small companies to operate as
global e-commerce businesses.

Competing with giants
With an increasing choice of goods
and services available online for
consumers, small businesses must
offer something more than the giants
in order to compete. Price is critical
because consumers can easily
compare prices online. But it is not
the only factor that affects an online

Whatever the goods being sold,
they must be of the quality stated,
because feedback on the Internet
can have a powerful effect on the
market. For hotels and restaurants,
feedback and ratings by customers
are now the norm, and many
consumers base their purchasing
decisions on other people’s
comments. A well-run, small,
family-owned hotel, which focuses
on excellent service and delighting
its guests, can build a reputation as
the number one place to stay in a
particular town—ahead of a big
chain hotel—because of review
websites such as Trip Advisor.

The Internet is really

information, highly
specialized targeting.

WORKING WITH A VISION 177
Small businesses can receive market information just
as quickly as large companies thanks to the Internet,
but due to their size are often better placed to respond
quickly and adapt to changes in demand, supply niche
products, and deliver a more personalized approach.

The Web does not just

Sir Tim Berners-Lee

Organizations recognize the power
of feedback and often encourage
customers to post comments
online. Fashion retailers, furniture
manufacturers, and retail stores—
even dental and medical practices
—invite customers to comment on
and share their experiences. Small
companies beneﬁt from this trend,
since their personal service is more
likely to generate positive reviews.

A more personal service
The Internet has removed the
“middle man” from many areas of
business. The travel industry is one
example, since travelers can now
book direct with airlines. Another
example is the book industry, where
authors can self-publish via the
Internet, taking their ﬁction straight
to readers without the need for
literary agents or big publishing
houses. The runaway success Fifty
Shades of Grey by E.L. James began
life as a free ebook on the Internet.
Previously, mass production and
limited space in brick-and-mortar
stores dictated the range of goods
a business could stock. Now, small
businesses selling niche products
or services can thrive because the
Internet connects them to
consumers looking for exactly these

offerings. People wanting to buy a
spare part for an old car, or a rare
edition of a book, can search and
buy from anywhere in the world.
Small companies can also thrive
through customization. Digital
methods of production and online
retailing enable narrowly targeted
goods and services to be proﬁtable.
Customized production of a single
item is possible—from personalized
books, mugs, and clothing to
customized cars, furniture, and
even houses, which can be
designed and tailored online.
Customers can get exactly the
item they want, delivered at the
right time and at a price they are
willing to pay. Websites offering
personalized printed items are
small businesses with software
that allows consumers to approve
the ﬁnal design and send it straight
to print, so employees are only
needed for packing and shipping.

Although small businesses can
thrive on the Internet through their
own websites, many now use portal
websites as a “store window” to
reach a wider audience. The British
company Not on the High Street is
one such portal. Started by two
working mothers as a marketplace
for personalized creative items, it
launched in 2006 with 100 small
businesses (many of them women
working at home). In 2013, the
business had grown to include
1,600 partners and had a turnover
of more than $23 million.
Not on the High Street is
successful because it combines the
idea of personalized products with
an awareness of the producer, giving
buyers the chance to select a local
maker. Although it promotes global
trade, the Internet can enable a very
personal form of communication
between buyer and seller, regardless
of size or scale. ■

KEY DATES
1776 UK economist Adam
Smith introduces the concept
of comparative advantage,
where one party has the ability
to produce a particular good or
service at a lower marginal
cost than another.
1960 US economist Theodore
Levitt says that rather than
ﬁnding a customer for their
existing product, businesses
should ﬁnd out what customers
want, and produce it for them.
1985 Michael Porter publishes
Competitive Advantage.

strategy for generating growth

demand is created in an
uncontested market space.

onsumers have choice.
And different consumers
will choose differently—
some like to pay the most for the
luxurious option, while others will
always opt for the cheapest.
Companies recognize this and
pitch their business at a particular
group of consumers. This is
because it is never wise for a
company to be caught between
groups of customers.
Harvard Business School
professor Michael Porter proposed
“generic strategies” for gaining
competitive advantage, explaining

Companies need to ﬁnd a competitive advantage.

They can do this by offering customers...

...the cheapest
product or service
on the market. This is
the strategy of cost
leadership.

that is outstandingly
good in some way.
This is the strategy

his idea in Competitive Advantage:
Creating and Sustaining Superior
Performance (1985). Porter used a
four-celled matrix to represent the
four different generic strategies
in his theory.
Companies generally choose
between two generic strategies:
either “cost leadership,” where they
aim to be the cheapest in the
market; or “differentiation,” where
they create unique products or
services. However, there is another
element that can be added to these
two generic strategies: a company
might choose to pursue a “focus

strategy,” offering a specialized
service in a niche market. This
position can be applied to both
of the initial generic strategies,
resulting in a cost-focus strategy
(where the company aims to be
cheapest within a niche market) or a
differentiation-focus strategy (where
the company offers unique products
or services within a niche market).

Cost-leadership strategy
Companies pursuing a costleadership strategy have two
options. They can choose to sell
products at average industry prices

to earn a greater margin than
competitors; or sell at below industry
prices to gain more market share.
Some supermarkets, such as German
retailer Aldi and UK company Tesco,
take the low-price approach to cost
leadership. They achieve this by
purchasing large volumes from closerelationship suppliers, and offer the
customer “deep discounts.” Their
slogans— Tesco’s “Every little helps”
and Aldi’s “Like brands, only
cheaper”—convey their drive to pass
savings on to the consumer.
Porter suggests that to pursue a
cost-leadership strategy, a company
has to be the leader in terms of cost
in their industry or market, rather
than be among a group of low-cost
producers, because this makes
them vulnerable. With ﬁerce
competition there is always the
chance for other low-cost producers
to reduce prices, and so take market
share. Companies that choose cost

leadership have to be conﬁdent that
they can both achieve the number
one position, and also maintain it.
Several requirements must be met
to achieve this, including: a low
cost base (across labor, materials,
and facilities); efﬁcient technology;
efﬁcient purchasing; well-organized
and cost-effective distribution; and
access to capital for any required
investment, to keep costs down.
These low-cost principles are
not exclusive to any one company,
however, and the risk is that they
are easily replicated. Companies
pursuing a cost-leadership strategy
have to build in continuous
improvement in all their processes to
ensure the company can keep costs
below those of other competitors.

Differentiation strategy
A company that pursues a
differentiation strategy has to make
markedly different products or
services from competitors, so they
have greater appeal to consumers.

■

The MABA matrix

This strategy is more appropriate in
markets where products are not
price sensitive, and customers’
needs are typically underserved. It
also means being able to satisfy
those needs in ways that are
difﬁcult to copy.
Bose Systems is a company that
pursues a differentiation strategy.
A privately owned US audio
electronics company, it consistently
reinvests proﬁts to fund innovation.
Customer-focused research has led
to Bose’s dominant position; their
noise-canceling headphones and
stylish speakers have become
aspirational items.
The approach to differentiation
will vary according to the products
and services, and the nature of the
particular industry, but typically
involves additional features and
functionality, enhanced durability,
and better customer service.
Companies that choose to pursue
this strategy require certain
fundamentals in place, including ❯❯

182 PORTER’S GENERIC STRATEGIES
good research and development, an
innovative culture, and the ability to
deliver consistently high-quality
products or services. This needs to
be supported by effective marketing,
so that the differentiation is
positioned and communicated to
customers. Brand image is integral,
and is often strengthened by the
nature of the differentiation.

Focus strategy

Airline strategies

Large markets

The airline industry illustrates
Porter’s idea. Consumers have a
choice when they book an airline
ticket. They can choose between a
no-frills airline or a more expensive
operator offering better service,
quality, and comfort. There may also
be a third option: a small airline that

Cost leadership

Differentiation

Niche markets

COMPETITIVE SCOPE

Companies pursuing a focus
strategy choose a particular niche
market. They have to understand the
dynamics of that market and the
unique needs of customers within it,
and then develop either low-cost or
well-speciﬁed products or services.
They also tend to serve their
customers well, and so build strong
brand loyalty. This makes their
particular market segment less
attractive to potential new entrants.
Ferrari is an example of a
company in a niche market that has
chosen to differentiate itself. The
company targets the limited highperformance sports-car segment,
and its cars are differentiated
through high-spec design, highperformance, and the company’s
Grand Prix association.

Whichever focus a company
chooses, it must do so on the basis
that it can successfully compete
on the strength of a particular
ability or competence that will
help it in its chosen market niche.
If the company aims for cost
leadership in a niche market, for
example, it has to be based on
distinctive relationships that have
been developed with specialized
suppliers. If the company goes for
differentiation in a niche market,
on the other hand, it has to be on
the strength of a deep understanding
of customer needs. However, a
company that chooses to focus on
a small market segment because
it is too small to serve the larger
market risks being sidelined by
bigger companies with distinctive
abilities, which enable them to
better position their offerings.

offers only a few routes. Airlines
tend to focus on a particular group
of travelers as an effective way of
achieving competitive advantage in
a crowded market, for example by
offering discounted travel or a more
luxurious traveling experience.
Low-cost, Ireland-based airline
Ryanair has championed the idea
of cost leadership, and describes
itself as “Europe’s only ultralow
cost carrier.” The notion of a lowcost airline was pioneered by
Texas-based Southwest Airlines,
and Ryanair followed with similar
principles: use a single plane type
to keep costs down, constantly
review overheads, turn aircraft
around as quickly as possible, and
do not offer a loyalty plan.
Ryanair bought 100 Boeing 737800 passenger jets at a signiﬁcant
discount in 2002. Starting with
newer, more fuel-efﬁcient planes
than many rivals, Ryanair could
afford to ﬁll its planes with
passengers buying low-price tickets.
However, Ryanair could make a
proﬁt because passengers would also
spend money on areas such as
on-board food and hotel reservations.
Ryanair is able to increase proﬁts
year after year since it continually
looks for ways to keep costs down
and charge customers for extras.

WORKING WITH A VISION 183
Singapore Airlines’ customer service
ethic is personiﬁed by “The Singapore
Girl,” who portrays the idea of Asian
hospitality. Her image has become
a successful brand icon.

These include being the ﬁrst airline
to implement baggage charges;
working to eliminate the need for
check-in desks (by offering online
check-in facilities); and charging for
options such as seat reservation
and priority boarding. This
consistent search for new ways to
transform costs is the essence of
the cost-leadership strategy. In the
12 months ending March 31, 2013,
Ryanair transported nearly 80
million passengers and announced
record proﬁts of $753 million,
despite a rise in fuel costs.
Singapore Airlines (SIA) by
contrast, pursues a differentiation
strategy. The brand’s major drivers
are groundbreaking technology,
innovation, quality, and excellent
customer service. It maintains the
youngest ﬂeet of aircraft among
major air carriers, and keeps to a
stringent policy of replacing older
aircraft with newer, better models.
SIA has always been ﬁrst to take
delivery of new aircraft types.

Singapore Airlines recognizes that
innovation is short-lived in the
airline industry. New features and
ideas can easily be copied by other
airlines, so it continues to invest
heavily in innovation and technology
as an integral part of achieving its
differentiation strategy. The airline
runs a comprehensive and rigorous
training program for cabin- and
ﬂight-crew to ensure the customer’s
in-ﬂight experience is consistently
excellent. The success of its brand
strategy and its entire positioning

around service excellence mean
that customers are more than
happy to pay a premium price.
Porter’s generic business
strategies can be used by any
company to achieve a competitive
advantage. However, the
competitive environment consists
of more than just present rivals;
changes in the industry and
environment add to a constantly
changing business context. For this
reason, strategy choice must be
regularly reviewed and checked. ■

Ice cream with a difference

Ben & Jerry’s ice cream is now part
of the Unilever brand, but continues
to use the differentiation strategy it
adopted to become a market leader.

Quirky ﬂavor names—such as
Imagine Whirled Peace, Chubby
Hubby, and Brownie Chew
Gooder—set Ben & Jerry’s ice
creams apart. Ben Cohen and
Jerry Greenﬁeld started the
company in 1978 and wanted it to
be alternative. According to Jerry,
“if it’s not fun, why do it?” Ben
claims to have no sense of taste,
so he relied on texture (what he
called “mouth feel”)—big chunks
of added ingredients such as fruit,
chocolate, or cookies therefore
became the brand’s signature.

Consumers are prepared to
pay a premium price because
of the ice cream’s all-natural,
high-quality ingredients and
innovative ﬂavors—months of
research go into perfecting the
taste. The company’s strategy to
differentiate itself from the
competition extends beyond the
product. The organization is
active in social campaigns such
as gay marriage, buys only from
fair-trade suppliers, and
considers environmental aspects
in production and delivery.

trategy is a concept with
its roots in military history,
when army generals planned
campaigns of war. Today, it is an
overused and often misunderstood
word in business theory. Put
simply, strategy is the way a
business gets from where it is to
where it wants to be; it involves
identifying the choices that must
be made to overcome the obstacles
that lie in the way. Often, choosing
what not to do is as important as
what to do. Strategy guru Michael
Porter ﬁrst drew attention to this in
1985, then speciﬁcally explored it in
his 1996 article “What is Strategy?”
For businesses, it is just as
possible to follow bad strategy

explained that good strategy
should emerge out of an analysis
of the company itself, and its goals.
SWOT analysis (strengths,

systems for such audits, and to be
effective it should be conducted
among middle managers and
people across the organization, not
just those at the top. Good strategy

Film is dead
The demise of Kodak is a prime
example of a company following
bad strategy. Founded in 1890, by
the 1970s Kodak was the US market
leader in the photographic sector,
with nearly 90 percent of the ﬁlm
and camera market. It was rated as
one of the world’s top brands. In
1975 Kodak engineers invented the

digital camera, but the senior
management of Kodak ignored the
opportunity presented by this new
technology. They believed they
were in the chemistry-based ﬁlm
business and were not prepared to
“kill the golden goose.” Executives
failed to see that digital photography
would make ﬁlm redundant and
challenge their near-monopoly
business. Japanese company
Fujiﬁlm, however, recognized the
threat and diversiﬁed successfully.
Kodak began its shift to digital
cameras too late, as smartphones
and tablets replaced cameras.
The senior executives’ inability to
make the tough decision to change
course led to the company being
declared bankrupt in 2012. ■

common ownership. The focus at
the time of the deal is often on the
event of joining together rather than
planning what will happen next.
Effective integration requires quick,
courageous decision making so that
time and momentum are not lost.
However, the most common
reason for failure is that the two
organizations have different
approaches and lack synergy.
In 1998, German car producer
Daimler-Benz bought US
automotive business Chrysler for
$38 billion. The logic seemed
obvious: create a trans-Atlantic
powerhouse that would dominate

motor markets. The new company,
DaimlerChrysler, was dubbed a
“merger of equals.” But the reality
was a classic culture clash. Daimler
was a formal, hierarchical
organization, while Chrysler favored
a more team-oriented approach.
Chrysler operated in a market
where low price and catchy design
were important; high-end Daimler
was focused on quality and luxury.
Chrysler executives felt
undermined in the new alliance
because Daimler tried to dictate
the terms on which the new
business should work and to place
its people in key positions. The
result was a costly corporate
divorce with Daimler-Benz selling
Chrysler to a private-equity firm for
a mere $7 billion in 2007. ■

1987 Ian Mitroff, Paul

“Effective Crisis Management.”
1988 Shrivastava, Mitroff,
Danny Miller, and Anil Miglani
say that organizational crisis
requires an interdisciplinary
approach, using psychological,
technological-structural and
social-political perspectives.
1995 A. Gonzalez-Herrero and
C. Pratt suggest a model for
crisis management: diagnosis
of impending trouble; decision
and actions; implementation of
change; and monitoring.

throughout history, from
natural disasters to manmade calamities. Businesses face
similar crises—internal or external
events can pose major threats to
the organization. Unpredictable in
nature, they require quick decision
making and action from leaders.
Globalization has increased the
complexity of the business world,
so an event in one country can

affect businesses across the world.
Digital, 24/7 communication means
that news travels far and fast. The
result is that crises may seem to
be more prevalent than they were
during the predigital age.

that they can strike anywhere.
Typical crises include technological

F Kennedy said, “in Chinese, the
word ‘crisis’ is composed of two
characters—one represents danger

cost, but consumer faith was retained.

loss or rising prices in raw materials;
and environmental disasters. Every
crisis has the potential to damage
a company’s proﬁts and reputation.
The extent to which it is able to
withstand a crisis and limit the
damage is determined by its ability
to respond fast and appropriately.

Planning and decisions
Effective crisis management
involves careful planning, so that if
a crisis strikes it can be addressed
in a calm, professional way. This
involves quickly establishing the
“who, what, when, where, and how”
of the crisis within the critical ﬁrst
few hours. Any crisis—no matter
how small—is newsworthy, so a
company’s public response must
be fast. Public perception affects
consumer trust.
Leadership during a crisis is
particularly important, since swift,
effective decision making is critical.
Every company recognizes that if it
handles a crisis well, damage can

In 1982, Johnson & Johnson reacted
to a crisis effectively when Tylenol
pain-relief capsules sold in the
Chicago, IL, area had been laced
with cyanide. The company recalled
the product, stopped advertising, and
reintroduced Tylenol in a triple-seal,
tamper-resistant package. The
public felt reassured by the move,
and once again trusted the product.
At around the same time, another
US company tried to contain a
similar crisis using a very different
approach. A woman returned a jar
of Gerber Product’s baby food to
her local supermarket, saying that
it contained a shard of glass.
Gerber ran laboratory tests and
found nothing; the store had lost
the shard, and the company
decided there was no problem on
its production line. However,
customers in 30 different states
then said they too had found glass
in the baby food. The company
could ﬁnd no evidence to support
these claims, so announced that
they were “being had” by people
wanting to ﬁle false liability claims.
They did not recall any products.
Public conﬁdence in the company
fell; some states demanded other
Gerber products be removed from
stores. Although the company’s
position was evidence-based, it
seemed callously indifferent to the
welfare of babies. It lost sight of the
essential rule in any crisis: always
show commitment to the safety and
well-being of your consumers. ■

Supplier roles in crisis
In their article “The Toyota
Group and the Aisin Fire,”
authors Toshihiro Nishiguchi
and Alexandre Beaudet
demonstrated the importance
of supplier relationships
during a crisis. In 1997, a ﬁre
at the plant of one of Toyota’s
most trusted suppliers, Aisin
Seiki, threatened to halt
Toyota-group operations for
weeks. Aisin Seiki was the
sole source for a small but
crucial part used in all Toyota
vehicles. Only two or three
days’ worth of stock was on
hand. Toyota’s manufacturing
plants shut down but were
reopened after only two days.
The recovery was achieved
through an immediate and
largely self-organized effort
by companies from within and
outside the Toyota group, who
set up alternative production
sites. The collaborative effort
of more than 200 companies
was orchestrated with limited
direct control from Toyota
and with no haggling over
technical proprietary rights
or ﬁnancial compensation.

Effective crisis management
is a never-ending process,
not an event with a
beginning and an end.

company needs cash to pay its wages
and bills. But if it focuses too much on
the immedate present, it risks
missing opportunities. Conversely, if

a company’s sole focus is on new

unproﬁtable. As Jack Welch, CEO of

In 1994, James Collins and Jerry
Porras studied companies such as
General Electric, Marriott, and 3M
that had been in business for more
than a century and that consistently
outperformed the stock market.
They used the Chinese yin-yang
sign—symbolizing complementary
opposites—to explain how
successful businesses maintain
control of both the short- and longterm. The organizations they
studied were able to manage
contradictory ideas at the same
time, by focusing on “both … and
…” rather than “either … or …”
They also demonstrated the
concept by performing well both in
the short-term and in the long-term.

Public and private
In a private limited company (Ltd),
managers can plan for different
time horizons without scrutiny from
shareholders. Sir Anthony Bamford,
for example, runs JCB, a privately
owned British company. JCB was
started by his father, Joseph Cyril
Bamford, who began making
agricultural tipping trailers in 1945.

Jack Welch

Today JCB is the third-largest
manufacturer of earth-moving
machinery in the world, with 22
factories in Europe, Asia, and North
and South America. Bamford can
invest when and where he chooses.
He decided to invest in India by
opening a factory in 1978, a longterm prospect that paid off; JCB
is now market leader there. In 2012,
JCB opened a factory in Brazil.
Unlike many CEOs, who hold a
post for a few years then move on,
Bamford saw that balancing the
short- and long-term is critical. His
dual focus has paid off: despite the
worldwide recession, JCB sales
grew 40 percent in 2011 and topped
£2.75 ($4.3) billion in 2012.
In contrast, a typical public
limited company (plc), owned by
shareholders and quoted on a stock
exchange, is under greater scrutiny.
These investors look for returns,
in the form of dividends, on an
annual basis. This can become a
strategic issue, since institutional

The MABA matrix
provides a means
of identifying which
business units should
be grown, held at their
current level, or sold.
Those at the top left of
the matrix have a high
business and market
attractiveness, and
should be grown. Those
in the center have
medium ratings for both
factors, and may warrant
selective investment.
Those at the bottom
right have low scores for
both factors, and should
be harvested for cash,
and sold or liquidated.

BUSINESS ATTRACTIVENESS

Using the matrix
The matrix allows a company to
judge each business unit on two
factors to determine its future
success: the attractiveness of its
industry or market, and the business
unit’s competitive strength within
that industry. Market attractiveness
is rated according to the market
size, growth rate, proﬁtability,
and level of competition. Business
attractiveness is rated according
to the unit or product’s current
and growth level of market share,
its brand strength, and its proﬁt
margins relative to rivals.
By plotting the attractiveness
of an industry on one axis and the
competitive position of a business
unit in that industry along the
other, large corporations can
compare the strengths of diverse
business units. The matrix
condenses the value-creation
potential of multiple business
units into a single, digestible chart.
Each business unit or product
must be evaluated, using data
analysis, and placed within the

matrix according to their market
and business attractiveness. This
sorts units into three categories:
those that should be “grown”
through investment, “held” (invested
in selectively), and “harvested” for
cash and either sold or liquidated.
Sorting units into these three
categories provides a starting point
for strategic analysis, and for

determining where to invest to
yield the highest growth. Over
the years, the criteria for assessing
industry attractiveness and
competitive strength have grown
more sophisticated. But even today,
most large organizations with a
formal approach to modeling their
businesses use the MABA matrix
or one of its derivatives. ■

Why Kraft gobbled up Cadbury

Foods bought British chocolate
manufacturer Cadbury for more

left of the MABA matrix. Kraft
was already the world’s secondbiggest food business with

it was generating 80 percent of

2009 alone, 69 percent of
Cadbury’s sales growth came

British company offered Kraft
greater access to these markets,

Staying alert
Points of sizable change are hard to

scan the horizon, like a ship’s
watchmen looking for an iceberg
that could sink the business.
Companies today use many
different approaches to monitor the
competition and market. Typically,
a large organization employs a
team of people to scrutinize the
company’s sales, compare them to
the competition, and analyze market
Black swans are rare but they do exist,
which comes as something of a surprise
to people who have only seen white

basing predictions on past experiences.

trends. They may also have a team
responsible for risk management,
which covers far more than
operational risks (such as safety).
In recent times, such teams tend
to monitor far-reaching global
concerns, including weather
extremes resulting from climate
change, political change, and
human-rights issues.
Successful negotiation of change
relies not just on scanning the
environment, but also making sense
of the incoming information. Senior
executives need to be particularly
wary of understanding events and
making decisions based solely on
data or past events. In The Black
Swan: The Impact of the Highly
Improbable, Nassim Nicholas Taleb
explains how individuals,
businesses, and governments place
too much weight on the odds that
past events will be repeated.
Forecasting the future from the
past ignores the fact that the future
holds different possibilities, as yet
unseen. For example, if you have
only ever seen white swans, you
might assume that all swans are

white; unless you traveled to
Australia and chanced upon a black
swan. Taleb used the metaphor of
the black swan to discuss major
scientiﬁc discoveries and historical
events. These “black swan events”
combine low predictability and high
impact. Examples include the 9/11
terrorist attacks in the US and the
stock market crash of 1987. Taleb
states that companies can never
predict black swan events, but they
do need to build robustness against
potential negative eventualities,
and be ready to exploit positive ones.

Listening to the front line
Grove claimed that business data
(like white swans) is relevant only
to the company’s past, and cannot
be used to predict the future. He
suggests that when searching for
clues about how to deal with the
future, executives should look
elsewhere, such as scrutinizing
any misalignment between the
company’s strategy statements
and its strategy actions. What is
the difference between what the
company says it is planning to do,

and what it is actually doing?
Actions are driven by the stark
reality of having to win business
in the marketplace against the
competition; a company’s front-line
personnel are likely to see and adapt
to a new reality ﬁrst. They are the
people best positioned to identify
critical issues.
This means that leaders in the
organization have to be prepared
to listen to people dealing with
customers and suppliers—who
often tend to be at the lower level of
a company’s hierarchy—and absorb
what they are saying. It helps to
have an organizational culture that
encourages this and ensures that
people are not afraid to speak out.
For the same reasons, it is
just as important for senior
management to listen to the kind
of information being exchanged in
corridor conversations, networking
functions, and the general ofﬁce
grapevine as it is for them to use
competitive analysis and modeling.

The “5-why” technique
To ensure they understand what is
driving or impacting a company’s
performance, and what is happening
in the market and the wider world,
senior executives have to constantly
ask questions. They also need to

understand not just “what” is
happening, but “why.” One method
to achieve this is the “5-why”
technique, invented in the 1930s
by the father of Kiichiro Toyoda,
the founder of Toyota, and used by
Toyota during the 1970s. By asking
“why?” ﬁve times, you can move
from the symptoms to the root cause
of a problem. For example, the ﬁrst
question might be “why did we
miss the deadline?” to which the
answer might be “it took longer
to complete the project than we
thought it would.” Why? “Because
we underestimated the complexity
of the task.” Why? “Because we did a
quick time estimate, without going
through the project requirements
in detail.” Why? “Because we were

already running behind on four
projects.” Why? “Because we are
not allowing enough lead time
when quoting.” The technique can
be used to interrogate internally
and externally caused problems.
It is also important to ask the
right questions. Management guru
Peter Drucker claims that “the most
serious mistakes are not made as a
result of wrong answers. The truly
dangerous thing is asking the
wrong question.”

Which questions to ask
Questioning goes beyond looking at
the competitive environment. Sales
bring in revenue, but companies
also have to look at costs, because
proﬁt lies in the gap between these
two. Managers must question their
processes, to see where they can
drive efﬁciencies, reduce costs, and
so improve their proﬁt margins.
Managers also need to constantly
question whether there might be
a better way to do something. For
example, perhaps nonessential
functions could be outsourced.
Managers have to be restless,
not complacent, and look for every
opportunity to increase the proﬁt
margin and improve the business.
Managers have to use their
knowledge and experience to
connect all the information they
gather, and try to anticipate what
the world will look like in ﬁve or ten
years’ time. What changes might
take place in that new world? They
then have to position the company
to take advantage. This requires
thinking through several different
scenarios and being able to think
“outside the box.” ❯❯

200 AVOIDING COMPLACENCY

Victorinox’s business model relied on
the sales of its Swiss Pocket Knives,
but a strategic inﬂection point—the
prohibition of knives on planes—forced
it to add luxury products to its range.

The impact of the 9/11 terrorist
attacks on the US in September
2001 was felt across the world; for
some businesses it proved to be
a strategic inﬂection point. One
such company was Victorinox,
manufacturer of the ubiquitous
Swiss Pocket Knife. The company
had been producing pen knives
since 1884, but it was hit by new
airline safety regulations that
prohibited knives to be carried
on board aircraft following the 9/11
attacks. This had a drastic effect
on Victorinox, because purchases
of its products at airports around
the world accounted for a signiﬁcant
portion of its annual sales.
Corporate sales also tumbled.
By the beginning of 2002, pockettool sales had fallen 30 percent in
just a few months. The company
recognized that this could
represent the start of a long decline,
and that to survive, action would

have to be taken. The development
of other products—including
watches, travel gear, fragrances,
and fashion—that could be sold
at airports was accelerated. The
company also began to explore
new market opportunities, such as
selling in China, India, and Russia.
Victorinox also took action to
preserve one of its core strengths—
a skilled and loyal Swiss work force.
Layoffs were prevented by taking
crisis measures such as reducing
shift times, canceling overtime,
encouraging planned vacations,
and temporarily lending workers to
other Swiss companies. Victorinox
not only survived, but thanks to its
new products, was able to enhance
its high-quality brand image. More
than 60 percent of the company’s
turnover now comes from items
other than pocket knives.

Averting catastrophe
To detect the approach of a strategic
inﬂection point, the CEO of a
company, in conjunction with the
board, must analyze all the available
hard data, listen to the softer
information, and then take decisive

action. British Petroleum (BP), once
owned by the British government,
became publicly owned in 1987.
Its new CEO was John Browne, a
nonexecutive director of Intel, who
was inﬂuenced by Andy Groves’s
thinking on the importance of
paranoia. Browne was concerned
about something far bigger than
rival companies—something that
could harm the business of not
just BP, but the entire oil industry.
Browne reviewed the available
data on climate change, listened to
experts in the ﬁeld, and considered
the impact on the business of BP.
He recognized climate change as
a slow-manifesting issue, but
realized it could impact the oil
industry. In 1997 he gave a seminal
speech at Stanford University, CA,
publicly acknowledging climate
change as a reality and committing
BP to do something about it.
This was a bold move for an
oil company at a time when rival
companies were trying to ignore
the issue. BP pursued a strategy of
investing in alternative energy, and
it was the ﬁrst oil company to set
targets for reducing its own
greenhouse gas emissions.
Employees were asked to ﬁnd ways

to help meet targets. Browne caused
more of a stir when BP launched
a new brand identity in 2000. The
bright green Helios logo, named after
the sun god of ancient Greece, was
accompanied by the slogan: “Beyond
Petroleum”. It represented the
company’s acknowledgement that it
needed to provide more, and smarter,
types of energy. It also sent a clear
message that the company was not
complacent; it was prepared to
confront and adapt to difﬁcult issues.
However, after Browne left
BP in 2007, the new CEO pursued
a different strategy, and the
alternative energy business was
closed down. Any environmental
credibility the company had built
was lost when an oil well exploded
in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.

Conquering complacency
In the late 1990s, UK retailer Marks
& Spencer (M&S) took almost the
opposite stance to John Browne at
BP. Board members largely ignored
the changing UK and global retail
environments, and chose to focus on
internal issues. The company was
hierarchical and employees were
expected to follow orders. In The
Rise and Fall of Marks & Spencer,

Andy Grove

author Judi Bevan describes a
traditional business environment
with carpeted executive ofﬁces,
waiters with white gloves, and
staff rules governing punctuality,
efﬁciency, and politeness. M&S did
not have a marketing department
and its executives believed it did not
need to advertise. Stores did not
accept credit cards, and payment
was possible only with cash or
M&S’s own charge card.
When rival retailers appeared
with a more modern vision and fresh,
contemporary designs, M&S’s

clothes and stores began to look
old-fashioned. Consumers started
to shop elsewhere, but still M&S did
not change course, despite a sudden
drop in sales and proﬁts. UK proﬁts
continued to tumble from a record
high of $1.6 (£1) billion in 1997 to
$232 (£146) million four years later,
and the share price dropped by twothirds. It was not until the emergency
appointment of CEO Stuart Rose in
2004 to fend off a takeover that the
dramatic decline was halted.
However, the recovery did not
last: M&S once again risked
complacency with a run of eight
successive quarters of falling
clothing sales to 2013. In response,
the company announced it would
invest in store revamps, logistics,
and IT, and unveiled plans to turn
M&S into an international,
multichannel retailer, connecting
with customers through stores, the
Internet, and mobile devices.
This is the challenge for all
organizations. Businesses must
contend with accelerated change in
a highly competitive, multichannel,
global market, and guard against
complacency—or risk losing out to
competitors who are able to stay
one step ahead. ■

involves personal teaching
intended to develop loyalty.
1950s Job training becomes
individualized, replacing the
teacher with programed
materials that employees work
through at their own pace.
1984 Professor Richard
Freeman proposes that
workers are “stakeholders”
and are vital to the survival
of the organization.
1990 Peter Senge publishes
The Fifth Discipline,
advocating “the learning
organization.”

W

development and
education of its employees it will
be able to reinvent itself constantly,
adapting to the market due to the
intellectual skills and commitment of
its employees. If the key to success
in a rapidly changing marketplace
is adaptability and foresight, then
it makes sense to train and foster
talented individuals as a means of
marshaling an entire organization.
This is the essence of what
management authority Peter Senge
called “the learning organization,”
a place “where people continually
expand their capacity to create the
results they truly desire, where new
and expansive patterns of thinking
are nurtured, where collective
aspiration is set free, and where
people are continually learning
how to learn together.” To reach
this ideal a company should adopt a
collective, community-minded
approach so that employees feel
part of a worthwhile enterprise
that will nurture them, and in
return those employees will show
commitment to the business.
Senge proposed his vision for
a corporate utopia in The Fifth

Discipline (1990). In this book he
set out the ﬁve disciplines to which
an organization should aspire in
order to succeed in the long term:
personal mastery; mental models;
shared vision; team learning; and
systems thinking—the ﬁfth
discipline, which incorporates
the preceding four.

The ﬁve disciplines
The ﬁrst two disciplines are
individual. By personal mastery,
Senge means that individuals
should use their own interest
and curiosity to improve their
capabilities. Mental models refers
to ingrained ways of thinking,
which should be challenged so
that individuals become aware
of why they think in a particular
way, and of the effect this has on
behavior. Senge encouraged
employees to analyze their own
subtle mental ﬁlters and to be
prepared to question and change
them in order to adapt to the future.
The remaining three disciplines
are collective. The goal of shared
vision involves the members of an
organization deciding together
what they want to create and
agreeing on targets and processes

to help them get there. In this way,
employees will work toward a goal
because they want to, not because
they are told to. Team learning is
the process of employees learning
together through discussion and
dialogue so that they become more
effective as a team than they would
be individually.
The fifth discipline is the ability
to see the organization as a whole,
with its own behavior patterns.
This capability is crucial in order
for people to recognize potentially
counterproductive behaviors that
have come about simply through
repetition and have remained
unchallenged over the years.

Mental
models

Employee turnover

It is pertinent that Senge’s proposal
appeared against a backdrop of
corporate brain drain. According to
a 2004 paper by Arie C. Glebbeek
and Erik H. Bax from Groningen
University, the Netherlands,
published in the Academy of
Management Journal, when the
labor market tightened and labor
scarcity grew during the 1990s,
businesses became concerned with
the detrimental effects of turnover.
Turnover of personnel is one
of the great blights of modern
corporations and nations alike.
A desire for further learning and
development motivates talented

individuals to move in search of
a better environment with more
opportunity for advancement. It is
estimated that the cost of replacing
an employee is between 10 percent
and 175 percent of the departing
employee’s salary, depending on
the field of skill. Data from the
OECD (Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development)
showed an increase in skilled labor
migration around the world starting
in the early 1990s. Much of this
drain was from developing
countries, and became gain for
host countries in North America,
Australasia, and Europe. But even
in advanced economies, brain drain
was a feature of corporate life.
During the 1990s, the highest
voluntary staff turnover rates in
Asia were in Singapore. The
Singapore hotel industry, for
example, had an average annual
turnover rate of 57.6 percent in
1997, while average annual turnover
rates in the retail industry ranged
from 74.4 percent to 80.4 percent
between 1995 and 1997. One

Business School in conjunction

School concluded that poor
management practices were the
major reason for employee turnover.
The problem of high turnover in
lower-paid jobs is still an issue. In
the January 2012 edition of the
Harvard Business Review, Harvard
Business School professor Zeynep
Ton wrote about companies that
had found a way to invest in their
staff while keeping product costs
low: “Highly successful retail
chains ... not only invest heavily in
store employees but also have the
lowest prices in their industries,
solid ﬁnancial performance, and
better customer service than
their competitors. They have
demonstrated that, even in the
lowest-price segment of retail, bad
jobs are not a cost-driven necessity
but a choice. And they have proven
that the key to breaking the tradeoff is a combination of investment
in the work force and operational
practices that beneﬁt employees,
customers, and the company.”

Learning by listening
Peter Senge’s theory about
corporate learning went beyond
just minimizing labor turnover. He
intended it to be a model by which
companies could maximize their

success by actively fostering the
education of all employees in order
to innovate and adapt. In this
respect, Japan’s Honda Motor
Company is often cited in case
studies as a perfect example of a
“learning organization.”
In the 1980s, while professor
of business studies at Stanford
University, Richard Pascale analyzed
the management style of Japanese
companies, Honda in particular. He
concluded that “organizational
agility” was the reason for Honda’s
success. As evidence he cited the
entry of the Japanese company into
the US market in 1959.
Honda had been preparing to
launch its larger 250 cc and 350 cc
motorcycles in Los Angeles, but the
advance sales team soon realized
that the big Japanese bikes were
inadequate for road conditions and
the vast distances traveled in the
US. The team reluctantly sent the
models back to Japan for testing.
Meanwhile, the three Japanese
salespeople had been zipping
around Los Angeles on the 50 cc
Super Cub, a best seller at home
but considered inappropriate for
the power-hungry American biker.
Nevertheless, US interest in the
Super Cub grew and Sears

Chris Argyris,

department store approached the
Honda team to ask if it could sell
the smaller bikes. The sales team
reported back to head ofﬁce and
advised that instead of launching
the larger bikes, the Super Cub
should be the focus of Honda’s debut
in the US. Instead of dismissing the
underlings, the managers took
notice and agreed to go with the
advice of the sales team. The result
for Honda was phenomenal success
in the US market. In Peter Senge’s
model, Honda is an example of how
“every level of an organization
should feel included and valued.”

Questioning precedents
In essence, Senge’s “learning
organization” draws on earlier
ideas, including those of Harvard’s
Chris Argyris. In 1977 Argyris
published his theory of “double
loop learning,” showing that
companies and their employees
can assess and modify underlying
ways of thinking to improve their
capacity to learn and perform
effectively. The following year
The Honda Super Cub became
enormously successful in the US,
thanks to managers who listened to
their sales staff and broke away from
the standard “macho biker” approach.

explored theories such as doubleloop learning.
Going further back, the ﬁrst
scientiﬁc studies of learning within
an organization were conducted in
the mid-20th century. Two theories

Peter Senge

in particular emerged to dominate
thinking in this area. The ﬁrst, from
Yale professor Charles Lindblom in
1959, was that action taken in
organizations is based on historical
precedent rather than on
anticipating the future. The second
was set out by Richard Cyert and
James March, who in 1963
published their observation that
behavior in organizations is based
A world-renowned expert on
management and organizational
learning, Peter Senge was born in
Stanford, CA, in 1947 and studied
aerospace engineering at Stanford
University. He went on to obtain
an MA in social systems and a
PhD in management at MIT, and
is now a senior lecturer at MIT’s
Sloan School of Management. He
is also the founding chair of the
global Society for Organizational
Learning (SoL).
Senge pioneered the concept of
“the learning organization”—an
organization structured in a way
that is conducive to new ideas,

on routines: the procedures,
conventions, or technologies
through which companies operate.
These perceived negatives became
the focus of scholars such as
Argyris and Senge. Interest in the
concept of the learning
organization grew in the 1990s, as
business conditions became more
uncertain and companies more
dependent on technology.
In 1993 management innovation
expert Mark Dodgson, then senior
fellow at the Science Policy Unit of
the University of Sussex, UK, linked
economic uncertainty and rapid
technological change to an
increased need for learning at all
levels in a company, citing the view
of psychologists that learning is the
highest form of adaptation.
Dodgson, like other scholars, made
a distinction between
“organizational learning”—when
organizations learn a lesson from a
particular event—and “the learning
organization,” which embraces a
continual process of education and
implements strategies to initiate
that process. In Senge’s opinion,
organizations focused on continued
learning will gain a competitive

occasion, a learning organization

proﬁts coming from their
top-selling items.
1990s The introduction of
the Internet proves to be a
disruptive technology that
changes economic and
social traditions.
2004 Chris Anderson coins the
term “Long Tail” to describe
the concept that a larger
proportion of sales is likely to
come from the tail, rather than
the head, of the demand curve.

The future of business
is selling less of more.

T

he “Long Tail” theory
challenges basic principles
of economics. In the past,
successful businesses often sold
high volumes of a limited number
of products. Now, according to
author Chris Anderson, the future
of business is in selling less of more
—low volumes of an increasingly
large number of products.

A primary factor in today’s global
economy is the Internet, which is
shifting the focus from mainstream
products and markets—represented
by the “head” of the demand
curve—toward a large number of
niche or low-volume products and
markets, as seen in the “tail” of
the curve. A conventional demand
curve is drawn with price on the

WORKING WITH A VISION 209

vertical axis, and quantity on the
horizontal axis, and demonstrates
that people buy more as the price
falls. Anderson represents sales on
the vertical axis and the number
of products on the horizontal axis,
showing that growth in many
industries will come from the niche
end of demand—the Long Tail.

Head

The Long Tail is based on a representation of a
demand curve of the future marketplace (sales are
shown vertically, products horizontally). Author
Chris Anderson suggests that overall sales of niche
products at the thin “tail” of the curve may be
greater than more popular products at the “head.”

Long Tail

Removing barriers
Supply was once constrained by
factors such as cost of production,
physical space for storage, and cost
of distribution. Digital processing,
online ordering, and electronic
distribution have removed many
of these barriers. Selling smaller
numbers of a greater range of items
can result in higher overall sales and
proﬁt than selling common items.
Books, music, and movies are
classic examples of the Long Tail
theory. A traditional bookstore can
only stock books that are likely to
sell. Amazon, however, can list
every book, even though some may
never be sold. Less popular titles
that are not stored in its vast
warehouses can be shipped direct

from a publisher to meet individual
demand. Combined sales of one-ofa-kind books may be larger than
that of bestsellers, and so may equal
more proﬁt. Similarly, iTunes can
offer a longer list of music than any
physical store, and Netﬂix can
stream almost any ﬁlm into your
living room. When offered almost
limitless choice, consumers exert
their preferences and spend money.
Asia is a large and growing
market, but it is fragmented by
many different cultures. Individual
countries offer numerous niche
opportunities for companies that

can tailor products and services by
language and ethnicity, rather than
offering to the mass market. Startups are recognizing the Long Tail
beneﬁts and using the region’s
diversity to their advantage. One
example is Brandtology, an online
company that analyzes social media
and online chat, in local languages,
for clients in Singapore and Hong
Kong. Native speakers of languages
such as Mandarin, Japanese, and
Korean offer social-media analysis
to provide localized insights and
interpretation of key issues within
a particular culture. ■

power
of suppliers.

...the bargaining
power
of buyers.

...rivalry among

The strongest competitive force—which varies according to the
industry—determines the overall proﬁtability of the industry.

industry and develop a position
that is more proﬁtable and less
vulnerable to attack. According
to Porter, there are ﬁve competitive
forces that collectively deﬁne an
industry’s structure, shape the
nature of competitive interaction
within an industry, and ultimately
determine proﬁtability. Now
referred to as Porter’s Five Forces,
this model places existing
competitors at the center,
surrounded by four other forces:
customers, suppliers, potential
entrants, and substitute products.

Using Porter’s model
Porter used commercial aviation
as an example to explain the model
in action, because the strength
of all ﬁve forces makes the airline
business one of the least proﬁtable
industries of all. At the center are
established rivals (such as Qatar
Airways, Virgin, and Qantas),
who all compete intensely on price.
Customers can search easily for the
best deal. Suppliers—in this case
aircraft and engine manufacturers

and unionized labor forces—take the
lion’s share of proﬁts. New players
enter the industry on a regular
basis. Substitutes are available
in other forms of transportation,
such as trains, buses, and cars.
Where the forces are much
weaker—for example in the
software, soft drinks, and toiletries
industries—companies can make
a bigger proﬁt. In all industries,
proﬁt can be affected by weather
or cyclical change in the short term,
but in the medium and long term,
it is the structure of the industry
that drives competition and
proﬁtability. Porter is adamant that
other factors—such as the type of
product or service, the maturity of
the market, regulation, or level of
technical complexity—are not
deﬁning factors for proﬁtability.

The force of “rivalry”
Of the ﬁve forces, rivalry among
existing competitors is the major
determinant of competitiveness
and proﬁtability within an industry.
In a very competitive industry,

market share is tough to win and so
proﬁts are harder to make. Intense
competitor rivalry occurs when
there are many competitors, growth
in the industry is slow, products are
not differentiated and can be easily
substituted, competitors are of
equal size, customer loyalty is low,
and it is difﬁcult and costly to exit
the industry.
The hotel business is just such
an industry. In a city such as New
York, there are many hotels. Guest
numbers are relatively static, so ❯❯

similar growth is slow; within a
speciﬁc star-rating the hotels are all
fairly similar, as are the sizes of the
big hotel chains. Customers can
choose to go to any hotel, and have
good access to prices. Exit from
the industry is difﬁcult because
of the upfront investment. Many
large hotel groups have introduced
loyalty programs as part of their
strategy to differentiate their brand.

Substitutes
The most signiﬁcant of the ﬁve forces
is not always the most obvious one.
For example, even though rivalry is
often ﬁerce in commodity industries,
that may not be the factor that
ultimately limits proﬁtability.
The “threat of substitutes” force
is surprisingly important here—
buyers in these markets can easily
ﬁnd substitute raw materials or
products that have attractive prices
or are higher quality. What’s more,
buyers can switch from one product
or service to another with little
cost. For example, it costs relatively
little for a consumer to switch from
tea to coffee, unlike switching from
traveling by bicycle to car.
In some industries, companies
try to limit the threat of potential
substitutes by ensuring wider

product accessibility. For example,
soft-drink manufacturers have
achieved this by introducing
branded vending machines, so
competitors are unable to offer their
products at that particular place.

Buyer power
Buyers can demand lower prices
or higher product quality from
producers when their bargaining
power is strong. Both scenarios
result in lower proﬁts for producers,
because lower prices mean lower
revenues, and higher-quality
products usually incur higher
production costs. Buyers exert
strong bargaining power when
there are few of them; they buy
in large quantities; they are price
sensitive; they control distribution
to the ﬁnal customer; there are
many subsititutes; and switching to
another supplier can be done at low
cost. Buyers may also be able to
produce the product themselves—
so may use this as a threat.
Buyers for big supermarkets have
huge bargaining power in the food
and drink industry. Fresh milk is
often at the heart of supermarket
price wars, because the big chains
have signiﬁcant buying power over
suppliers. UK farmers have claimed
that they are so pressured to reduce
prices that they often make a loss
on each bottle of milk produced.

substitute raw materials or
suppliers. Their power is increased
if they are large and can threaten
to step in and produce themselves.
Oil is an example of a scarce
resource that is controlled by a few
countries. OPEC (Organization of
the Petroleum Exporting Countries)
represented the political power of
oil-exporting countries in 1973 when
it placed an oil embargo on the US.
OPEC’s action disrupted supply and
forced up the price of oil four-fold.

New entrants
If an industry is proﬁtable and there
are few barriers to entry, Porter says
that competition will increase and
proﬁts will fall. Typically, existing
organizations try to create ways to
deter new entrants. The threat of
new entrants is high when the cost
of entering the market is low; there
is little government regulation;
customer loyalty is low; existing
businesses can do little to retaliate;
and economies of scale can be
easily achieved. Risk is increased
if existing companies have not
established brand reputation and
do not possess patents, and when

Supplier power
When the bargaining power of
suppliers is strong, it allows them
to sell higher priced or lower quality
raw materials. This directly affects
the proﬁts of the company that is
buying, because it has to pay more
for its raw materials. Suppliers have
strong bargaining power when
there are few of them (but many
buyers); they hold scarce resources;
the cost of switching raw materials
is high; and when there are few

Buyer power is high in the food and
beverage industry because consumers
can easily ﬁnd a substitute that may be
cheaper or differentiated, such as by
offering increased nutritional beneﬁts.

products are nearly identical. An
example of a market with a low
threat of new entrants is the software
market for personal computers.
Microsoft came to dominate the
market with its Windows 95
operating system. New entrants
found it hard to break in because
programs such as Excel, PowerPoint,
and Word are universally used.

Choosing a position
Porter used the US heavy-truck
manufacturer Paccar to illustrate
the principles of choosing how to
position a company within a given
industry structure. In a crowded
market, Paccar wanted to ﬁnd a
space where competitive forces
were weak, and where it could avoid
buyer power and price-based rivalry.
In the heavy-truck industry,
where large ﬂeet buyers dominate,
it is hard to create a niche based
on differentiation. Paccar, based in
Washington state, chose to focus
on one group of customers: owner-

operators. Personal pride in their
own trucks and the fact that they
were economically dependent on
their vehicles made them less
price-sensitive as purchasers.
Paccar therefore decided to invest
in developing an array of features
with owner-operators in mind, such
as luxurious sleeper cabins, leather
seats, noise-insulated cabins, and
sleek exterior styling. They offered
thousands of options for owners to
put their personal signature on their
trucks, by simply inputting them on
computers at network dealers. They
also offered roadside assistance
and fuel-efﬁcient, aerodynamic
designs. As a result, Paccar has
been proﬁtable for more than 68
years in succession, and delivers
better-than-average returns.
No matter how different
industries appear on the surface,
Porter’s model offers any company
a way of assessing proﬁtability
through analyzing ﬁve easily
calculated, competitive forces. In
revealing an industry’s underlying
structure, Porter’s model simpliﬁes
a mass of information, providing
managers with a clear process for
making sense of industry data and
using it to form effective strategy. ■

IF YOU DON’T HAVE
A COMPETITIVE
ADVANTAGE,

THE VALUE CHAIN
IN CONTEXT
FOCUS
Competitive Advantage

The interconnected activities through which a company delivers
products or services can be viewed as a “value chain.”

KEY DATES
1933 US economist Edward
Chamberlin introduces the
concept of product
differentiation in Theory of
Monopolistic Competition.
1970s The idea of competitive
advantage takes hold as
Japanese companies begin
to outsell US and European
rivals. This is later attributed
to superior management.
1979 US marketing consultants
Al Ries and Jack Trout write
Positioning: the Battle for Your
Mind, outlining how companies
should build a strategy around
their competitors’ weaknesses.
1985 Michael Porter introduces
his theories of competitive
advantage and the value chain
in Competitive Advantage:
Creating and Sustaining
Superior Performance.

The chain consists of primary and secondary
value activities.

Primary value
activities include inbound
logistics, manufacturing,
outbound logistics,
marketing and sales,
and after-sales service.

Secondary value
activities include
procurement, HR,
technology, and
infrastructure.

Through analysis of its value chain, a company can identify where
to achieve cost or differentiation advantage on its products.

T

he goal of every company
is to create and sustain a
competitive advantage so
that it can sell more products and
generate higher proﬁts than its
rivals. As Jack Welch, CEO of US
multinational General Electric and

celebrated business guru, advised:
“If you don’t have a competitive
advantage, don’t compete.”
US professor Michael Porter’s
“generic strategies” consist of two
types of competitive advantage: cost
advantage and differentiation

advantage. Porter identiﬁed a set
of activities that businesses can use
to better understand how to achieve
these forms of differentiation. These
interrelated activities—dubbed the
“value chain” by Porter—describe
the ﬂow of a product from its initial
supply to the ﬁnal customer.
A company can add value to the
product at each stage of the chain,
through product-related activities—
its inbound logistics (supply of parts
or materials), manufacturing, and
after-sales service—and marketrelated activities: outbound
logistics (the delivery of products
to the end user), and marketing
and selling the product.

Gaining the advantage
To achieve competitive advantage,
a company cannot focus on one
activity alone, but needs to
consider each of the activities in
the chain. For example, MercedesBenz pursues a differentiation
strategy, ﬁrst through producing a
high-end product, but also through
providing outstanding after-sales
service. Analyzing the value chain
can also help companies to identify
what areas of their business might
be suitable for outsourcing, which
can help the company to achieve
a cost advantage.
Primary value-chain activities in
a company are supported by a series
of secondary activities, which can
also be used to achieve competitive
advantage. These activities vary
by industry, but typically include:
purchasing (procurement); human
resource (HR) management;
technology development, including
research and development (R&D);
and infrastructure functions, such
as ﬁnance and legal. Although
support activities may be viewed

and you’re competing with
the big boys—you either

as “overheads,” secondary value
can be generated, for example,
through better use of technology.
In addition to their horizontal
activities, companies operate in a
“value system” of vertical activities,
such as a manufacturer who buys
parts from suppliers and outsources
its distribution. Competitive
advantage relies not only on the
company’s value chain, but on the
value system of which it is a part.

Red, yellow, or purple?
Fashion retailer Benetton,
launched by the Benetton
family in Italy in the 1960s,
pursues a differentiation
strategy with its bold brand
image. To achieve this, the
company has focused on every
aspect of its value chain, from
supply to satisfying the latest
consumer fashions. To ensure
Benetton garments are
up-to-the-minute, the company
manufactures many of its
clothes in gray, then dyes
them to meet the demand for
whatever colors are in fashion.
Although this is costly in
production, it minimizes stock,
reduces wastage, and enables
the company to respond
quickly to changing consumer
tastes. Benetton stores are run
by agents, and garments are
shipped directly to the stores
and immediately placed on the
shelves. This creates a strong
value system, keeps costs
lower, and allows each part of
the chain to absorb ﬂuctuations
in demand. Benetton has more
than 6,500 stores in more than
120 countries, and its turnover
exceeds $3.2 (€2) billion a year.

Reinventing value
Porter’s theories on competitive
advantage were highly inﬂuential,
and have been built upon by other
business theorists. Management
scholars Richard Norman and Rafael
Ramirez argued in 1993 that the
market complexity of the 1990s
required companies to “reinvent”
the notion of value beyond the linear
thinking of the “chain.” In 1995,
US executives Jeffrey Rayport and
John Sviokla drew parallels with
the emerging world of the Internet,
suggesting that value could be
added to online activities and
products in a “virtual” value chain. ■

Benetton’s value chain boosts
its differentiation advantage.
Clothes can be dyed in fashionable
colors to match customer taste.

B

usiness processes are a
series of actions taken to
achieve an outcome. The
objective might be to produce a
product, to pay an invoice, or to
serve a customer, for example. Adam
Smith was one of the ﬁrst people
to describe business processes,
when he dissected the many
manufacturing processes used in
an 18th-century pin factory. From
describing the different actions, he
developed the idea of division of
labor, where work can be divided
into a set of simple tasks performed
by specialized workers, in sequence.

Continuous improvement
The sequence of steps in a process
can often be visualized as a ﬂow
chart. As Watts Humphrey, inventor
of the capability maturity model
(CMM), pointed out, it is always
“good to know where you are” in
the process. Humphrey developed
the idea that continuous process
improvement is based on many
small evolutionary steps, rather than
large, revolutionary innovations.
His CMM provides a framework for
organizing these evolutionary steps
into ﬁve levels of development,
each of which prepares the way for
the next. The CMM was developed

Adam Smith observed workers making
pins in a pin factory and realized that
if the process were split into separate,
specialized steps, productivity would
increase by 240 to 4,800 times.

The CMM describes ﬁve levels of
increasing maturity through which
an organization or team manages
its processes: in the ﬁrst level, work
is conducted in a chaotic and illdeﬁned way; in the second level,
processes are put in place and
adhered to with some discipline,
and previous successes can be
repeated; in the third level, processes
are deﬁned, standardized, and can
be proactively implemented; in the
fourth level, they are managed and
monitored; and in the ﬁfth level,
they undergo regular improvement
through monitoring and feedback.

The strength of CMM is its effective
measurement of the standardization
of an organization’s processes. This
is why the model moved from being
used to assess software development,
to applications in project
management, risk management,

Managing chaos
Scientiﬁc chaos theory, which

systems such as the weather,
can be related to organizations.
Effective leadership, clear vision,
open communication, and strong
values are necessary to deal with
such complexity. Leaders need to
set clear boundaries, then allow
individuals and teams enough space
to self-organize, self-regulate, and
make their own decisions. Creativity
and growth are enabled because
employees have a higher level of
responsibility and accountability
for their work, as well as a bigger
investment in the outcome.

collaborate more readily with
external partners, rather than merely
transacting with them, to encourage
adaptability and shared learning.

Creativity from chaos
A potential source of chaos is
internal change and reorganization
of a company. Involving and
engaging the employees is the
answer to managing this. In the
most complex ﬁnancial services
integration ever to occur in Europe,
Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS)
was acquired by Lloyds TSB
following the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008.
External chaos (unprecedented
economic turbulence) was mirrored
by internal chaos—6,000 branches
and 30 million customers had to be
brought together to form the biggest

retail bank in the UK. The new
company had to create one new
identity, one new way of doing things,
and streamline its IT systems and
differing organizational cultures. It
also needed ways of communicating
positively to customers.
But the biggest challenge of
all was common to many situations
of business chaos—motivating
employees who were harassed by
customers and worried about their
own jobs. Through constant
communication (including daily
team brieﬁngs on internal changes),
workshops on team problem solving
and vision building, and measures
for gathering ideas from staff and
customers, the combined companies
showed that chaos can not only be
managed, but may be a rich source
of growth for a business in ﬂux. ■

1987), when stock markets
around the world crashed.
His timing could not have
been better. In the book Peters
laid out a future of change,
stating that everything known
“for sure” about management
would be challenged—and
that 100-year-old traditions
of mass production and mass
markets would be threatened.
His forecast was correct. What
had been a fairly predictable
business environment
disappeared; organizations
and managers had to embrace
change, or face collapse.
Peters correctly predicted
that the business winners
of the future would deal
proactively with chaos,
seeing it as a source of market
advantage. Successful
companies would be those
who could create and add
quality and value continually
to their products and services
in response to the evershifting desires of their
customers. He described
this as “a revolution.”

Aquinas also asserted the ﬁrst
principles for the marketplace,
pointing out that the price set
for a product is a moral issue.

A more moral world
The notion of what is acceptable
in the business world today has
changed radically from earlier
centuries. Slave labor was
the norm for cotton and sugar
plantations in the US until
the mid-19th century. At the
same time, workers (including
children) were exploited during
the industrial revolution in Europe,
being forced to work long hours,
at low wages, in unhealthy
conditions. A pioneer in showing
that business could make a proﬁt
while pursuing an ethical path
was Welsh social reformer Robert
Owen, whose New Lanark Mill,
near Glasgow, Scotland, became
world famous for its moral rather
than commercial values.
Today, companies have to
consider every aspect of their
operation—from sourcing
ingredients to marketing policies—
in order to be judged ethical by their
consumers. Employment policies are

very important. The Institute for
Ethical Leadership, based in
Canada, deﬁnes an ethical business
as “a community of people working
together in an environment of
mutual respect, where they grow
personally, feel fulﬁlled, contribute to
a common good, and share in the
personal, emotional, and ﬁnancial
rewards of a job well done.” There is
a shared understanding that success
depends on a myriad of relationships
—both internal and external—not all
of which are under the organization’s
control, but which it can inﬂuence
through the ethical way it operates.
An ethical business that employs
people from diverse backgrounds
starts by agreeing and documenting
its own principles or standards,
which are often termed the
company’s “charter” or “code of
conduct.” These standards become
the reference point for decision
making in the working environment,
particularly when employees are
faced with difﬁcult decisions.
However, it takes more than a
written pledge to ensure an ethical
business. Organizations have to
foster a culture in which it is far

leadership expert Stephen Covey.
Faced with daily decisions about
the right way to behave, employees
have to know what “doing the right
thing” actually means. A company’s
policies covering everything from
safety to accepting gifts from
suppliers exist to ensure that people
understand how they are expected
to conduct business appropriately.

Driven from the top
Companies that prioritize an ethical
culture often select employees for
their values as much as their skills,
and ensure that new employees are
made aware of their role and
responsibilities, and also how things
are done in the organization. Such
companies are eager to ensure that
new staff both hears the company’s
values and sees them afﬁrmed in the
actions of people around them.
Such a culture has to be driven
from the top. US economist Milton
Friedman famously said that the
social responsibility of business is
to increase its proﬁts “subject to

the limits of law” and “rules of the
game” that ensure “open and free
competition without deception or
fraud.” However, the 2007–08
ﬁnancial crisis showed clearly that
codes, laws, and regulations are not
enough to maintain ethical business
standards. Leaders with personal
integrity are vital to enact and
encourage ethical behavior
throughout an organization. By
espousing the company’s principles
at every opportunity and at every
level, leaders can continually
demonstrate their importance
within organizational culture.
In Principle-Centered Leadership,
Stephen Covey describes trust,
respect, integrity, honesty, fairness,
equity, justice, and compassion as
the “laws of the universe,” classing
them as essential values for ethical
leaders. Covey is best known for his
book The 7 Habits of Highly
Effective People, in which he
proposed that ineffective people try
to manage their time around
priorities, whereas effective people
lead their lives and manage their

relationships according to principles.
These natural laws and governing
values are universally valid.

Ethical leadership
Typically, leaders in ethical
organizations are not domineering.
They are likely to have an open,
engaging style and to be good
listeners, able to tune in to issues
across the business. The company
they create will have a clear
structure with well-deﬁned roles and
responsibilities, be transparent,
with promotion based on merit, and
a well-communicated strategy, so
that employees know what they
have to do and where they ﬁt in.
Leaders with personal integrity
are a powerful inﬂuence on others.
Numerous studies have shown
that good people can make bad
decisions when acting in groups,
particularly in stressful situations.
To avoid the risk of unethical
“groupthink,” the CEO has to set
the right tone for everyone in the

teamwork and communication
between the board and the CEO. A
board that has a deﬁned structure
and a healthy culture of debate will
be more likely to recognize emerging
problems and take timely,
appropriate action.
This was not the case at Enron, a
company that has become one of the
most infamous examples of
unethical leadership. The Enron
Corporation started as a small gaspipeline business in the US and
grew to become the nation’s
seventh-largest publicly held
corporation. CEO Jeffery Skilling
actively cultivated a culture that
would push limits; his mantra was
“do it right, do it now, and do it
better.” But despite a clear set of
values for employees to espouse,
executives manipulated accounting
rules and disguised enormous losses
and liabilities. Enron collapsed in
2001; Skilling and chairman Ken Lay

including money laundering, bank
fraud, insider trading, and conspiracy.

targets and has a full-time “green
guardian” to focus on improvement.
The company also has a “Conscience
Team,” made up of people from
across the organization, which is
responsible for addressing social,
environmental, and ethical issues.
Ethical companies often
demonstrate ethical commitment by
partnering with organizations that
can help them to improve their
standards. Ted Baker is a member of
Made-by, a European not-for-proﬁt
organization that strives to improve
social and environmental conditions
in the fashion industry and to make

practice. Any company partnering
with Made-by must analyze the
ethics of every aspect of operations,
from the ﬁbers used in products to
factory conditions for workers.
Companies can also inspire
customers to act in a socially
conscious way: some garments
carry a symbol of a crossed-out
trash can, encouraging consumers
to recycle them.
Ethical business is also good
business. Customers are attracted to
companies they can feel good about,
more talented staff is attracted and
stays longer, and shareholders are
shielded from the type of share-price
falls that overtook Enron. ■

Ethical trading depends on more than internal business practices and
culture: a company’s materials, suppliers, and business partners must also
be ethically sound. To aid transparency, some companies and organizations
publish data on aspects of their business, such as production locations,
energy mix, recycling levels, and diversity among employees.

230 INTRODUCTION

B

y deﬁnition, marketing
is the ﬁeld of management
devoted to selling. It is the
link between production and proﬁt,
providing the expertise for taking
a product or service through the
most appropriate channels to ﬁnd
the people most likely to buy it.
To fulﬁl this goal, it is crucial to
become adept at understanding
the market. This means closely
studying the behavior and lifestyle
of the customer so that a product
or service can be developed to be
irresistible in every way, from the
purpose, function, quality, and look
of it, to the speed at which it is
delivered, the places it is sold, its
price, and the level of customer
service support offered.

Naturally there are dangers
inherent in trying to predict
the future using this type of
forecasting. The marketer must
also be aware of changing tastes,
technology, politics, and economic
conditions, so that the business
can adapt quickly, avoiding what
management scholar Theodore
Levitt famously called “marketing
myopia.” For example, as consumers
have become increasingly reliant
on mobile phones and tablets,
businesses with foresight have
developed mobile-commerce
channels and reaped the beneﬁts.
In the quest to anticipate
customer needs and wants, some
of the most progressive companies
gather data and examine it on a
daily basis so that key elements

Knowing the customer
That is the theory. In practice,
making your customers love you
by always putting them ﬁrst and
fulﬁlling their needs and desires is
the biggest challenge of marketing.
Collecting data about the purchase
history of customers is a starting
point. Combined with analyzing
any available demographic and
lifestyle statistics, such data can be
used to build a marketing model—
essentially a mathematical formula
that indicates potential purchase
rates for a given set of variables.

Marketing takes a day to
learn. Unfortunately it takes
a lifetime to master.
Philip Kotler
US marketing expert (1931–)

of the “marketing mix”—such as
the product or service itself, the
places where it is sold, its price,
and any promotional offers—can
be adjusted accordingly. Japanese
camera company Konica Minolta,
for example, uses specialized
technology to monitor sales data,
competitor activity, and market
trends in real time so that
it can respond effectively.

Marketing strategies
Arguably the product or service
offered is the most critical
component of the marketing mix.
For most companies, each product
or service in its product portfolio
has its own cycle of growth, and
can be managed to maximize proﬁt
by prioritizing the marketing
spend. For example, for food group
Mars, its best-selling namesake
chocolate bar has been a longstanding source of proﬁts, funding
the corporation’s expansion into
other areas, such as ice cream
and pet food.
To help decisions about
diversifying into such new markets,
companies can use a diagrammatic
tool such as Ansoff’s Matrix, which
plots existing and potential
products or services according
to the risk factors involved. If a
business decides to develop and

SUCCESSFUL SELLING 231

market something new, how it
presents the offering and gets
the message to consumers is an
important consideration. In planning
a launch, another valuable tool, the
AIDA Model, provides clear-cut
criteria for deﬁning the features of
any new product or service: how it
grabs consumers’ attention, holds
their interest, generates desire, and
is perceived to be attractive.
Concurrent with developing a
speciﬁc product or service for a
particular market, creating a brand
is equally important. The goal
should be to make the brand
synonymous with a set of unique
product qualities. In the words
of marketing expert Seth Godin:
“A brand is the set of expectations,
memories, stories, and relationships
that, taken together, account for a
consumer’s decision to choose one
product or service over another.
If the consumer ... doesn’t pay a
premium, make a selection, or
spread the word, then no brand
value exists for that consumer.”

Promoting the product
Once the optimal product or service
has been developed in conjunction
with brand identity, there is the
question of how to get the word out
to potential customers. Promotions
and incentives—such as special

offers, sweepstakes, and price
discounting—can be deployed
in the short term to garner initial
interest. They can be especially
effective for product launches in
areas where many rivals ﬁght for
shelf space, such as household
cleaning and candy.
One of the oldest strategies for
communicating with customers is
word of mouth. In the age of social
media, generating buzz about a
new product or service increasingly
relies on reaching speciﬁc groups
through Facebook, Twitter, YouTube,
and other online means, and
encouraging them to spread the
word. When a branded video goes
viral, the potential global reach runs
into tens of millions. If relatively
low-cost communications methods
like this are effective, it can lead
marketers to ask, why advertise?
But for long-term image building,
and for reinforcing brand values,
advertising still has a role to play.
For example, a sustained advertising
plan can take an audience from
children to adults with recognizable
slogans, jingles, and formats.

Staying on message
Businesses must carefully consider
the messages that they send to
customers and their rivals, since the
marketplace can judge them harshly.

Companies found to have acted
dishonestly or conveyed partial
truths about their eco-credentials
can be accused of “greenwashing,”
and will ﬁnd it hard to win back
public opinion. In fact, no matter
how appealing a company’s sales
proposition, consumers increasingly
want the people they buy from to
have a social conscience. For this
reason, it is vital for management
to consider the role of ethics within
the organization, and to develop the
company’s code of behavior toward
suppliers, employees, consumers,
and the community. Although
shareholders may see corporate
responsibility as the least important
commercial priority, it is now an
integral part of the marketer’s
strategy for successful selling. ■

Gathering and using data

marketers and others in an
organization can measure projected
product growth, or return on
investment, and make informed
decisions on how to optimize the
combination of factors most likely
to generate market success.
Gathering the required data for
modeling is crucial. Information
is needed from all areas of the
business so that every step in the
process of getting the product from
the drawing board to the customer
is factored in. When David Packard,
the co-founder of Hewlett-Packard,
said that “marketing is far too
important to leave to the marketing
department,” he was implying that
the plans made by marketers can
come to nothing if the rest of the
organization is not fully engaged. In
addition to getting approval on plans
and budgets, marketers should
communicate with all departments
to gather data and share it once
decisions have been made.

Market research is valuable, but it
can be very time consuming to gather
data that is representative of the age,
gender, and background of consumers.
Computer models do the work faster.

The origin of marketing models
Models of consumer behavior
date from the 1960s. They grew
out of a need to make marketing
more scientiﬁc and less driven
by instinct or unproven ideas.
In the 1960s US scholar
Robert Ferber advocated the
use of mathematical simulation
techniques and models. These
became known as measurement
models because they were
devised to measure demand
for a product as a function of
various independent variables—
for example, if the selling price

is raised by one percent how
might this affect demand? Then
in 1969 Stanford University’s
Frank Bass devised his Bass
model, which is still used to
predict how fast new products
will be adopted and spread
through a market.
Decision Support Systems
(DSS) use measurement models
to project the outcome of new
decisions, adding variables—
such as previous outcomes in
similar contexts—to help
marketers make optimal choices.

advised that a business centered
on the customer was the only sure
way to realize growth. “There is
only one valid deﬁnition of business
purpose,” he wrote, and that is “to
create a customer.” By this he
meant that a customer’s willingness
to pay for goods or services is the
catalyst that propels businesses to
turn raw materials and resources
into products for sale. Without the
customer’s desire or need, there is
no impetus for commercial activity;
and conversely, without commerce,
nothing can be produced to meet
the customer’s demand.
Drucker suggested that when
customers buy something, they
are not thinking about the product
or service itself, but about the
usefulness of it to themselves.
For them, value lies in the problemsolving ability of the purchase.
Although Drucker’s idea is
now at the core of most modern
marketing theory and practice,
at the time it was a counter to the
prevailing management approach

insulted one of his own products,
joking that its low price was
possible due to its poor quality.
Offended customers abandoned
the store and $800 (£500) million
was wiped off the value of the
company, which nearly went under.
This notorious example shows how
businesses who treat customers
with contempt can pay a very
high price.
This theory placed the wealth of the
corporation, rather than the needs
and wants of the customer, at the
core of a business. It held that
business should be run solely to
increase proﬁts, which would boost
the value of stock prices and allow
the company to return value to the
shareholders—who, after all, own
the business. This way of thinking
had been introduced by economist
Milton Friedman in an article he
wrote for The New York Times in
1970, and it was later developed
further by business professors
Michael Jensen and William
Meckling in their paper, “Theory of
the Company.” As the title implies,
Jensen and Meckling’s thesis was
not generally concerned with the
world beyond the company—it
focused on the relationship between
upper management and shareholders,
rather than the relationship between
management and the market.

21st-century thinking
The concept of shareholder
maximization was a dominant force
in the last few decades of the 20th
century, but the importance of
understanding the market and of
customer-centered management
has gradually gained favor, partly

because the corporate-centered
strategy has proved no guarantee
of longevity. Business in the 21st
century has become more peoplecentered with a number of huge
success stories helping to sway
management further toward
customer-oriented strategies.
In 2010, business professor
Richard Martin wrote an article for
the Harvard Business Review,
heralding “The Age of Consumer
Capitalism.” He claimed that we are
now living in an era in which
shareholder value is no longer the
primary goal. “For three decades,
executives have made maximizing
shareholder value their top priority,”
he wrote. “But evidence suggests
that shareholders actually do better
when ﬁrms put the customer ﬁrst.”
An example of a serious failure
to prioritize the customer is that of
the British jewelry company, Ratners.
By the late 1980s, Ratners was the
world’s biggest jeweler, with 2,000
stores on two continents. The
stores sold jewelry at low prices
and were very popular—until the
disastrous speech by the company’s
chief executive, Gerald Ratner, at
the Institute of Directors in 1991. In
his talk, supposedly about the
company’s success, he instead

Knowing the market
Since Drucker’s initial proposition
that a business must get to know
the customer intimately, the market
place has matured, making the task
of understanding the consumer,
customer groups, and the market

of the reasons is fragmentation,
meaning that consumers are now
divided among many small markets
that are constantly in ﬂux, and may
suddenly emerge from nowhere.
These micromarkets are deﬁned by
the common aspirations, likes, or

a wide spectrum of external factors,
so it is crucial to understand these
to get to their hearts and minds.
Price cutting by competitors, for
example, can divide the customer’s
attention, providing enticement but
also potentially damaging a brand’s
value in the eyes of the consumer.
A business therefore needs to know
how sensitive their existing and
potential customers are to price.
The distribution system, which
determines how products and
services get to potential buyers, is
also a vital aspect to consider. A
business should ﬁgure out how to
deliver products and services in a
way that best suits purchasers. The
Internet has transformed how this
happens, and customers now
expect sellers to understand where,
when, and how they want to buy.

environment. These encompass
gender, life stage, income, trends,
current issues, and the inﬂuence of
key individuals in the public eye.
The challenge for the marketer
is ﬁnding out how all of these
things inﬂuence customers and,
consequently, what motivates them
to buy. The obvious starting point
is to ask questions. This basic
premise developed during the 1960s
and 1970s into a formal process
of question-and-answer known
as market research. Researchers
gathered both quantitative evidence
(from simple questions directed
toward a large audience) and
qualitative evidence (through direct
observation or in-depth discussion
with a small sample of individuals).
Qualitative research is usually
regarded as the more valuable of
the two in getting a grasp of why
a customer accepts or rejects a
product, and in understanding the
realities of customers’ lives.

Personalized marketing
Since the 1990s, business has forged
a direct path of communication
with the customer via the Internet.

Marketers have developed new
strategies for online information
gathering, such as personalized,
or one-on-one, marketing, in which
a single consumer’s interests
and wants can be recorded and
compiled to create a detailed proﬁle.
Psychographic proﬁling is one
way that marketers attempt to
make sense of diverse consumer
interests, by corralling individuals
with shared interests and
motivations into groups that can
be targeted. Whereas businesses
used to deﬁne their customers
demographically, for example as
Baby Boomers or Generation X,
a psychographic proﬁle is much
more detailed. It is put together
by using information about a
consumer’s daily habits; favorite
brands, music, and athletic
personalities; media habits;
leisure activities; vacation
destinations; and much more.

The ﬁeld of neuroscience has
taken the idea of customer
understanding to the next level,
advancing Drucker’s premise that
businesses needed to drill down
into the customer psyche and
discover how decisions are made.
Several studies by branding guru
Martin Lindstrom have caused a
sensation by proposing that, no
matter how consumers may answer
in face-to-face research, the only
way to know what subconsciously
motivates them to buy is to measure
changes to their brainwaves when
exposed to certain images, sounds,
and smells. According to Peter
Drucker, “the main objective of
neuromarketing is decoding the
process that take place in the

SUCCESSFUL SELLING 241
customers’ mind, in order to
discover the desires, wishes, and
the hidden causes of their options,
so that there is a possibility to get
them what they want.”
Neuromarketing is one way of
understanding the customer, and
it is actively used by companies
such as Google and Disney to test
consumer impressions. However, it
is not in itself a solution to knowing
what customers want to buy. A
broader perspective is needed to
truly understand a market and the
elements that shape it. In some
cases it is pure innovation, driven
by a desire to transform the way
people live through technology, that
gives customers something they
didn’t realize they wanted, though
the need for it was there. Apple’s
iPad is an example of how forward
thinking about what customers
lives could be like can lead to
market success.

Innovative solutions
When the iPad was unveiled in
2010, investors and the press were
sceptical, wondering who would
want one, given that a laptop
computer had more functions and
was only slightly bigger. The iPad
was a sellout because customers
loved using it—it was fun and fast,
and allowed them to do all the
things they enjoyed on their iPod
touch but with a bigger screen and
a keyboard that was easier to use.
Apple CEO Steve Jobs claimed
in an interview with Fortune
magazine never to have done
consumer research. “It isn’t the
consumer’s job to know what they
want,” he reportedly said. “That

doesn’t mean we don’t listen to
customers, but it’s hard for them
to tell you what they want when
they’ve never seen anything
remotely like it.”
Steve Jobs instinctively
understood what the consumer
wanted because he had the same
problem: the lack of a well-designed,
portable device that would make
communication and informationgathering fun and easy.

Although Peter Drucker emphasized
the importance of knowing the
customer, he did not narrow this to
just asking the customer what they
want; he intended that business
should also think ahead and ﬁnd
ways to innovate. “The “want” a
business satisﬁes may have been
felt by the customer before he was
offered the means of satisfying it,”
he reasoned. “It remained a
potential “want” until the action
of businessmen converted it into
effective demand. Only then is
there a customer and a market.”
Professor Ranjay Gulati
maintains that the ﬁrst step in
understanding the new, highly
competitive market of the 21st
century is asking customers the
right questions; the most important
ones being what problems and
issues they are dealing with. But
he says that a business must make
a creative leap to ﬁgure out the
innovations that will serve those
customer needs, if they want to
survive in the market place. ■

Marketing models
KEY DATES
1898 E. St. Elmo Lewis
describes the principle that
would become AIDA.
1925 US psychologist Edward
Kellogg Strong Jr. refers to
AIDA in The Psychology of
Selling and Advertising.
1949 US marketing executive
Arthur F. Peterson expresses
AIDA as a sales funnel, in
Pharmaceutical Selling,
Detailing and Sales Training.
1967 US professors Charles
Sanclage and Vernon
Fryburger propose the EPIA
model: Exposure, Perception,
Integration, Action.
1979 US academics Robert
L. Anderson and Thomas
E. Barry propose adding
brand loyalty to the various
hierarchy of effects models
based on AIDA.

T

he AIDA model is the
foundation of modern
marketing and advertising
practice. It outlines the four basic
steps that can be used to persuade
potential customers to make a
purchase. The ﬁrst three steps lie
in creating attention (A), developing
interest (I), and building desire (D)
for the product, before the fourth
step—the “call to action” (A)—tells
them exactly how and where to buy.
AIDA is often expressed as
a funnel, because it channels the
customer’s feelings through each
stage of the communication process
toward reaching a sale.

AIDA in practice
Attracting the customer’s attention
is the ﬁrst challenge, and this may
be achieved by using an arresting
catchphrase, offering a discount or
something for free, or demonstrating
how a problem can be solved. Once
someone’s attention has been
seized, it must be turned into
genuine interest. This is best done
by providing a succinct assessment
of the product’s beneﬁts to the
consumer, rather than simply
listing the product’s main features.
Problem-solving claims, resultsbased advice, or testimonials can

be used to create desire, before
ﬁnally laying out a simple way for
that desire to be met—the means
to buy. On website advertising, this
might be a direct link; on TV, print,
or billboards it may be a website,
store name, or telephone number.

Commercial potential
In the movie industry, the stages of
AIDA are used to great effect. Movie
studios often begin their marketing
campaigns months in advance with
giant billboard posters to attract
attention to the new movie. Short
“teaser” trailers follow, which provoke
interest by offering a tantalizing
glimpse of the movie without
giving too much away. Desire is
instilled by the release of the full
trailer, which is carefully crafted to
show the highlights of the movie,
from big explosions and special
effects to witty lines of dialogue.
On the opening weekend,
advertisements in newspapers and
on television spotlight the movie’s
release, provoking action by
inviting the consumer to go and
buy a ticket.
One of the movie hits of 1999,
The Blair Witch Project, had an
innovative approach to AIDA that
made use of new viral marketing

techniques. Before the movie’s ﬁrst
showing, the ﬁlmmakers created a
website that offered an intriguing
insight into the background to the
movie. It presented snippets of
movie as “found ﬁlm footage,” and
left viewers wondering whether
the story of the movie was ﬁction
or reality. The website grabbed
attention, and continued to gain
interest as more video clips and
audio ﬁles were added. The buzz
around the “myth” of the Blair Witch
grew, creating further desire to see
the movie. The call to action came
in the form of a very limited release;

moviegoers were urged to buy
tickets before those few showings
sold out. The movie cost just $35,000
to make, but generated revenues of
more than $280 million worldwide.

E-marketing and AIDA
The advent of e-commerce prompted
award-winning UK copywriter Ian
Moore to suggest NEWAIDA as a
more relevant model for e-marketing:
AIDA preceded by navigation, ease,
and wording. It seems that as
markets have become more complex,
marketers require ever-clearer ways
of perceiving the customer journey. ■

The AIDA model
ATTENTION
Make the customer aware of the product or service using an
eye-catching advertisement or an arresting offer.
INTEREST
Hold the customer’s interest by providing infomation
about the advantages of the product or service and
its beneﬁts to the customer.

Who invented AIDA?
Management expert Philip
Kotler references Edward
Kellogg Strong Jr.’s book The
Psychology of Selling and
Advertising (1925) as the
source of AIDA. However,
Strong’s book gives credit for
the idea to advertising pioneer
Elias St. Elmo Lewis (1872–
1948), maintaining that Lewis
formulated the slogan “Attract
attention, maintain interest,
create desire” in 1898 and
that he later added the fourth
term “get action.”
The ﬁrst use of the AIDA
acronym is commonly
attributed to C. P. Russell’s
article “How to Write a
Sales-Marketing Letter,”
published in the US advertising
trade magazine Printers’ Ink in
1921—Russell was also one of
its editorial staff. He outlined
the basis of the four-step
process and pointed out that
“reading downward, the ﬁrst
letters of these words spell the
opera Aida.” He advised,
“When you start a letter ... say
‘AIDA’ to yourself and you
won’t go far wrong ...”

DESIRE
Generate the customer’s desire to buy
by convincing them that the service
or product will meet their needs.
ACTION
Make it as easy as
possible for the
customer to make
the purchase.

In practice, few messages
take the consumer all the way
from awareness to purchase,
but the AIDA framework

a good message.

Wroe Alderson stresses that
a business needs to grow and

1981 US marketing thinkers
Philip Kotler and Ravi Singh
coin the term “marketing
hyperopia” to describe the
problem of businesses having
a clear view of distant issues
but not of close ones.

W

hen a company has a
ﬁxed idea of what
products or services it
wants to sell, and a narrow idea of
who it is selling to, it runs the risk
of failure because it is not easily
able to adapt to changes in market
conditions. It will miss opportunities
to expand and conquer new market
areas. Harvard Business School
professor Theodore Levitt dubbed
this lack of foresight “marketing
myopia,” a term he ﬁrst used in an
article of the same name, published
in the Harvard Business Review in
1960. He stressed that a company

needs to look ahead and constantly
evaluate new openings in the
market. If it does not, growth will
stagnate and, ultimately, decline.
In Levitt’s view, when a
business is concentrating on how
to sell its products and is blind to
the changing circumstances and
desires of customers, it will not be
prepared for shifts in the market.
For example, a sudden change in
the economy or government policy,
a new technology, or a social crisis
can have an almost immediate
effect on the buying public. If a
company is prepared for such

changes, and ﬂexible enough to
adjust, it can ﬁnd ways to tempt
customers and prosper. The astute
approach, Levitt said, is to build a
business around the customer,
rather than around the company.
He proposed that “an industry is a
customer-satisfying process, not a
goods-producing process.”

Grow or die
Underlying Levitt’s idea is the
inevitable growth pattern of a
business. At ﬁrst a business enters
the market with a product or
service and may enjoy rapid

SUCCESSFUL SELLING 247
See also: Finding a proﬁtable niche 22–23

growth. But all growth eventually
tapers off because the market has
already bought enough of the
product or service, or develops
different priorities. The company
with marketing myopia turns
inward to see how it can trim the
costs of manufacturing or make
other internal cost-saving measures.
These tactics may offset a decline
in proﬁts for a while, but eventually
they will not be enough to save the
business from failing. Levitt,
however, reasoned that an industry
can continue to grow long after the
obvious marketing strategies have
been used, if the management is
totally focused on the customer.
Levitt asked the corporate
heads of America in 1960, “What
business are you in?”, demanding
that they shift their focus from
manufacturing to customer
satisfaction. This concept is taken
for granted in the current age
geared to customer analysis and
niche marketing, but given that the

1950s, enjoying its most prosperous

era for several decades, Levitt’s
idea may not have seemed very
relevant at the time. Still, he cited
convincing examples in US industry
to support his case. In particular, he
accused automobile manufacturers
of marketing myopia.

The automobile industry
On the surface, the US auto
industry appeared unstoppable. By
1960 the “Big Three” in the city of

■

Detroit (General Motors, Ford, and
Chrysler) dominated the domestic
and global markets. They produced
93 percent of the automobiles sold
in the US, and controlled 48 percent
of world sales. One-sixth of the US
work force was employed directly or
indirectly by the industry.
Nevertheless, cracks were
beginning to show.
In 1955, the Big Three had
enjoyed a record year. However,
demand fell dramatically in 1956
and 1957 because so many
consumers had already bought
cars. This sales slump was partly
responsible for the recession of
1958, during which manufacturing
as a whole declined. This was
the ﬁrst economic downturn in
the US since the Great Depression.
Meanwhile, car manufacturers in
Germany, the UK, France, and
Japan were threatening the
dominance of the Big Three.
“Detroit never really researched
the customer’s wants,” alleged
Levitt. “It only researched the kinds
of things which it had already
decided to offer.” By the time US
carmakers realized what had
happened, they found it difﬁcult to
adjust. After a series of dud models
and marketing failures, they ﬁnally
rebounded in 1965 with the
ubiquitous “muscle” cars such as
the Ford Mustang—but they would
never again have such an iron grip
on the market.

management attention; instead
it was a formulaic task left to the

But “Marketing Myopia” prompted
both the corporate and academic
worlds to start thinking differently.

Taking marketing seriously
Around the same time that Levitt
was writing that pivotal article, he
inspired a student, Philip Kotler,
who would take his proposition
further to cement a fundamental
change in the way managers
approached business. Kotler
studied at Harvard in 1960 for his
postdoctoral work in mathematics,
having already completed a PhD in
economics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT).
Exposed ﬁrsthand to the ideas of
Levitt and other marketing
professors, he began to develop a

By 1964 Avis was expanding. The

the Middle East, Colin Marshall,
was another believer in Levitt’s
customer-centered approach, and
deployed it with great success.
Within ten years he was running
the entire company from New York,
overseeing innovations that gave
customers better service, and
making Avis the market leader. In
1981, when he was recruited to help

tactic was not to cut air fares but

Marshall saw that the customer
experience went beyond check-in,
in-ﬂight, touchdown, and passport
control, and he introduced the
world’s ﬁrst arrivals lounges.

Customer experience
Other full-service airlines have
adapted the BA model. Most
airlines now rely on optimizing
customer relationships in order to
gain a long-term, competitive
advantage. United Airlines, for
example, has implemented a
system that lets staff identify highvalue frequent ﬂyers and proactively
offer them special services if their
ﬂight is canceled. American Airlines
has promoted its use of technology
to make the ﬂight experience more
appealing for customers, becoming
the ﬁrst with permission from the
Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) to allow ﬂight attendants to
use tablets to help them manage the
onboard experience more efﬁciently.

customer experience through
internet access and applications on
iPads, tablets, and cell phones is
now a vital consideration in many
sectors of industry, something on
which Google has capitalized.
In 2005, Google purchased a
little-known company called Android
Inc., which was developing a
smartphone platform. Two years
later Apple released its iPhone and
rapidly dominated the market;
customers loved it since they could
replicate the world of the Internet
on a handheld device. Online
search giant, Google, saw that it
risked becoming beholden to Apple
for access to sell its applications so,
with other cell-phone makers, it
developed an alternative—an opensource operating system that would
work on all mobile devices. Google
now had a platform through which
it could generate proﬁt with sales of
applications and in-app advertising.
Kotler cites Google as a model
of innovation, always seeking new
ways to solve customers’ problems
and help them manage vast amounts
of information. Levitt would have
agreed with the ﬁrst line of Google’s
corporate philosophy: “Focus on the
user and all else will follow.” ■

uses the term “cash cow”
in the context of business
management.

T

he term “cash cow” refers
to an investment or area of
business that provides a
dependable source of revenue. In a
corporate context, the cash cow is
the product or service that buoys
proﬁts year in, year out and provides
funds so the business can grow. It
brings cash in, which becomes the
lifeblood: contributing most of the
operating expenses; paying for
development, launch, and support of
new products; and propping up it’s
less proﬁtable ventures.

As entrepreneurs, we adore
shiny new things. But don’t
forget to give some love to the
(cash) cows that keep the
business going.
John Warrillow
UK entrepreneur (1971–)

Cash generator
The cash cow is typically a product
that has reached maturity in its life
cycle. Like its real-life counterpart,
its initial cost has been paid off, it
needs little maintenance, and it
can be “milked” for the rest of its
life. Although such products may
no longer be growing, they still
generate substantial revenue
because they have good market
share and no longer require much
capital outlay to keep them going.
Management veteran Peter
Drucker is said to have ﬁrst used
the “cash cow” metaphor in the
mid-1960s; he certainly referred to
it throughout his career to describe

a product that is an easy cash
generator. He was drawing on the
history of commerce in his analogy:
livestock such as cows, goats, and
camels served as currency from
around 9,000 BCE. While Drucker
understood the value of the cash
cow, at the same time he cautioned
against overreliance on it. He
advocated a strategy of planned
abandonment when the cash cow
is challenged by another product,
potentially a rival within the
company’s portfolio, which is
growing faster.

The Boston Consulting Group
In 1875, the Boston Safe Deposit
and Trust Company was set up
in its home port in New England
to offer safekeeping services to
local merchants and ship owners.
Run by several generations of the
prominent Bostonian family, the
Lowells, the company had grown
by the 20th century to become a
prominent ﬁnancial institution.
In 1963, a chance meeting
between the Boston Safe
Deposit and Trust Company
CEO John Lowell and one of the
US’s brightest management

thinkers Bruce Henderson (1915–
1992) led to the founding of the
Boston Consulting Group (BCG).
This management consultancy
was essentially a one-man band
with Henderson at the helm.
Henderson had been a Bible
salesman before completing an
engineering degree at Vanderbilt
University, Nashville, and going on
to study at Harvard Business
School. He joined Westinghouse
Corporation before graduating,
becoming one of the youngest
vice-presidents in the history of

the company. Initially ﬁnding it
difﬁcult to land clients and
compete against larger
consultancies, Henderson came
up with the idea of offering
“business strategy” as a unique
service. A few years later, with
a team of 36, Henderson devised
the now-famous growth-share
matrix (1968). His company,
BCG, has since grown to
become a signiﬁcant global
management consultancy
employing more than 2,000 staff
in 75 ofﬁces around the world.

The BCG matrix

so companies can

a well-balanced
product portfolio.
Products with a
high market share
are plotted into cells
on the left-hand
column, and those
with low market
share on the right.
The top row is home
to products with high
potential for growth,
while those in the
bottom row are in
declining markets.

“Stars” are products that have a
large market share in a growing
market. These require investment
to maintain their position and help
them grow into the dominant
product in the market. They have
the potential to be a future cow.
“Cows“ are products that were
once stars. They continue to hold a
large market share, but they are
mature products in an established
market that has little potential for
growth. They no longer need much
investment, because they have
reached their growth potential, and
as market leaders they sell in large
numbers of units, giving them the
advantage of economies of scale.
This means they generate cash
while costing very little.

The matrix in practice
can use this information to make
sure it has a mix of products that
will satisfy its short- and long-term
needs, and to think about the priority
and resources they should allocate
to each product. The matrix assesses
products on two levels: ﬁrst, the
potential growth in the market for
that product; second, the market
share held by each product.

Using the Boston matrix
By using the matrix, managers can
see where their products fall among
four categories: dogs, question
marks, stars, and cows. “Dogs” are
products that have low growth
prospects and a low market share.
These products may be making a
loss, barely breaking even, or
possibly generating a tiny amount
of proﬁt. Because they are in a
slow-growing market, there is little
chance that performance will
improve under current conditions.
Products that fall into this cell of
the matrix are candidates for

culling from the product portfolio.
However, before the dog is sold off
or disposed of, management must
consider if it is worth keeping for
strategic reasons. For example, if it
is blocking a competitor product or
the market for that industry is likely
to pick up in the future, it might be
worth retaining. Or it may play an
important role in complementing
another product in the portfolio
and providing customers with a
stepping stone to that product.
Like the dog, the “question
mark” product also has a low share
of the market, but it is in a highgrowth industry. Products in this
box can create a dilemma for the
company. If it is new, does the
product need more time to prove
itself, and more investment in
manufacturing or marketing? Or
does it need more market share,
which could be arranged by buying
up competitors? Perhaps it needs
repositioning in the market. Or
should it be dropped entirely?

Nestlé is often cited by management
theorists as a textbook example of
how a company might arrange its
product portfolio according to the
BCG matrix. The world’s largest
food company, with some 8,000
brands, Nestlé has developed a
strategy of building its long-term
cows and keeping them as fresh as
possible, devoting capital to

H. C. Barksdale and C. E. Harris

“dodos.” Warhorses lead the market

F

irst published in 1957 in the
Harvard Business Review,
Ansoff’s matrix is a
marketing tool for planning the
strategic growth of an organization.
Created by mathematician Igor
Ansoff, it is intended for businesses
that are ready to expand and have
the resources to fund growth. The
matrix offers four possible strategies
that a company might adopt,
depending on the status of its
product and the conditions of the
market: market penetration, market
development, product development,
and diversiﬁcation. In addition to
presenting these four strategic
options, the matrix also attaches an
inherent risk factor to each one. It is
crucial for decision makers to take
the risk factor into consideration,
lest it gamble too heavily with the
company’s existing resources.

greater sales might be achieved
through competitive pricing,

by driving out competitors.
“Market development” entails
selling the same product in different
markets. Additional spending may
be unnecessary unless localization
is required, but the cost of setting
up distribution channels in the new
market poses some risk. In this
model, different geographic or
demographic markets, or alternative
sales channels—such as online or
direct—might be tapped.
“Product development” strategy
is the sale of new or signiﬁcantly
improved products to an existing
market. Here, the cost of product
development, associated
distribution, and marketing support
poses a risk. Companies adopting
this strategy might offer variants of
the product, or develop related goods.
The ﬁnal, and riskiest strategy, is
that of “diversiﬁcation”—moving into
new product areas and new

markets. This strategy reduces risk
in the long term by alleviating a
company’s reliance on core products.
However, a company can risk a great
deal, depending on the initial
outlay, and needs to have plenty of
resources if the strategy fails.

A risky venture
UK supermarket Tesco’s venture
into the US shows the risks of
diversiﬁcation. After 10 years’
preparation, it launched its Fresh &
Easy stores in 2007, but misread the
market. Positioning itself in the
middle, it was neither upscale nor
discount, with most of its outlets in
working-class suburbs where
consumers looked for bargains.
Critically, Tesco’s small-scale,
walk-in stores did not suit the
average car-dependent US shopper.
The investment did not pay off,
costing Tesco over $1.9 (£1.2)
billion. The outcome may not have
been forecast by Ansoff’s matrix, but
the risk would have been clear. ■

Is Ansoff’s matrix
still relevant?
Igor Ansoff (1918–2002) is
remembered as the father of
modern marketing strategy.
His matrix has generated many
variations over the decades
and became one of the
foundation stones of business
strategy, underpinning ideas
such as core competence and
competitive strategy.
In the 1970s Ansoff
recognized the problem of
“paralysis by analysis”—the
overthinking of a problem and
subsequent failure to act. He
advocated a more ﬂexible
approach, based on local
conditions and a company’s
individual cirumstances.
Ansoff’s matrix has
limitations. Because it focuses
on market potential and
strategies for growth, it is not
able to support other factors
and scenarios, such as the
resources available, or if a
company’s priority is survival
rather than growth. However,
used with other marketing
tools, it remains valuable and is
still used to gauge actual and
expected growth.

As companies became
increasingly skillful strategy
formulators, the translation of
strategy into results ... created

ﬁrst. With the rise in self-service
stores and supermarkets, brands
had to catch the consumer’s eye on
the shelf and also appeal on an
emotional level. Persil, for example,
played on a housewife’s pride in the
whiteness of her laundry with the
slogan: “Get your whites right.”

Creating a brand
Today, a brand is more than just a
logo or attractive packaging. Brand
creation has to start with an idea,
and the idea is more likely to be
successful if it is different than the
competition’s. Typically, it starts
with the customer and what they
want or need. It might also be based
on the way the new company or
product is fulﬁlling a gap in the
market. Pret A Manger, for example,
launched its healthy fast-food cafés
as an alternative to the ubiquitous
burger chains. The brand revolves
around the concept of fresh, additivefree food prepared daily at every
branch. Alternatively, a new product
might be something that improves
on the existing technology through
new and innovative design, such as
Dyson’s bagless vacuum cleaners. Or
the idea might be something that no
one has thought of before, and did
not even know they wanted, like the
iPad, which has become
indispensible to millions.
One of the key things about a
successful brand, such as Apple or
Dyson, is that they build an
afﬁliated community—people who
like iPads or prefer Dysons, and are
happy to be identiﬁed with the other

members of that group. The most
powerful brands even have
identiﬁable ”nonbelievers”—think
Coke vs. Pepsi, or Mac vs. PC. The
sense of belonging to a group that
seems to share your own values is
a key part of consumer loyalty.

with the launch of an airline in
1995, is now used by more than a
dozen different businesses all over
the world. The “easy” idea had
many different elements that
brought it to life—from the way
people book their tickets online
to the no-frills service onboard—
but the essential idea of selling a
basic service at an affordable price
was translatable to many other
forms of business.

Vision and values
The different elements that make

262 CREATING A BRAND
the individual values and vision
take the brand from an idea on a
piece of paper to a commercial
reality. The vision for the company
reﬂects where the founders or
directors want to take the idea. The
vision of the furniture store IKEA,
for example, is to create “a better
everyday life for the many people.”
The business idea that supports this
vision is to offer good-quality
furniture at affordable prices. IKEA

all aspects of their business support

the shopping environment—such
as family-oriented restaurants and
children’s play areas—to
advertising. Today IKEA is the
world’s largest furniture retailer.

What kind of brand?
Values are another subtle element of
the brand, and summarize what the
brand stands for. It is important that
companies don’t just state their
values; they should be reﬂected in
the way the company operates.

Howard Schultz, who built Starbucks
into a global brand, had the idea of
a coffee company with a distinctive
personality that could create a
sense of connection. When Schultz
joined in 1982, Starbucks was a
single store in Seattle selling freshroasted, whole-bean coffees. The
name, taken from a character in
Melville’s Moby Dick, evoked the
seafaring tradition of early coffee
traders. Schultz traveled to Italy the
following year and observed that in
Italian coffee bars, coffee was more
than just a hot drink: it was an
experience that sparked daily
exchanges. He decided to bring the
Italian coffeehouse tradition back
to the US, where he had seen
limited casual social interaction.
The concept of the “third place”
was born—a place between work
and home where you can enjoy
conversation and a sense of
community. This idea became an
essential part of the brand and was
carried through in the café design:

cosmetics and beauty business, in
1976, with one store in Brighton.
Drawing on her own diverse
experience and travels in Europe,
Africa, and the South Paciﬁc, she
created natural cosmetic products
in recyclable bottles. The Body
Shop went on to shape ethical
consumerism because of Roddick’s
personal drive and the campaigns
that were promoted within her
stores. Roddick’s ﬁrm belief was

that businesses have the power
to do good, and she pioneered
the prohibition of animal testing
for cosmetic products, pushed
the adoption of fair trade, and
lent business support to political
causes such as Greenpeace and
Amnesty International.
In 2000 she published her
autobiography Business as

activist publications. She was
made Dame Commander of the

must be kept high for a long and
happy marriage between producer
and end user. The founder of
Selfridges, Harry Gordon Selfridge,
advised: “Remember always that
the recollection of quality remains
long after the price is forgotten.
Then your business will prosper
by a natural process.”
In the early 1980s, industries
ﬁrst quantiﬁed the impact of
product quality on proﬁtability
through studies such as PIMS
(Proﬁt Impact of Market Strategy).
Before this time, “quality” was not
usually a high priority for industry
leaders, but as research continued
to show the clear link to proﬁtability,
product quality became an
essential factor in strategies for
attracting and keeping customers.

Paying a premium
Even though a company may not
have the biggest share of the
market, it can still generate the
biggest proﬁt if its customers
perceive the product quality to be
so high that they are willing to pay
more for it. In the smartphone
market, for example, Apple’s iPhone
has a relatively small share but
garners around 50 percent of the
proﬁt. Making a desirable product

and building an emotional
experience around it can be enough
to make customers love you—so
much so that they are prepared to
pre-order, wait, and line up. This is
demonstrated most clearly in the
fashion world, where customers
willingly suffer the indignity of
scrambling for limited-edition
handbags or shoes, or—in the case
of luxury brand Hermès—wait
years for a bag. However, for most
businesses this is the exception.
Customers expect providers

all the stages of the buying process.
Although acquiring new customers
is always an important part of
marketing strategy, more income
is usually generated by existing
customers. These customers
will continue to buy the same
product or service, or may begin
purchasing other products from the
same provider. The business world
has come to recognize that some
customers are more proﬁtable
than others, and it pays to woo
proﬁt-inducing customers and
entice them to spend more.
In online retail, repeat purchase
can be encouraged by email
campaigns tailored to the buying

the business. Making your
customers love you therefore hinges
on both the quality of the product
or service and the beneﬁts for the
customer in remaining loyal to a
particular brand or company,
whether that’s for convenience,
a bargain, or a feel-good factor.

Cultivating loyalty
Pioneered by the airline industry
with its frequent-ﬂyer programs,
the idea of loyalty programs is
especially important to retailers.
A successful loyalty program will
not only offer customers a “moneyback” type of incentive, but will
also enable the business to gather
data about customer preferences,
spending habits, favored brands,
and reaction to promotions.
Retailers use this data to make
decisions about what products to
stock. Through its loyalty program,
US department store Nordstrom

preferences of customers, as well
as birthdays, anniversary dates,
and other personal information. It
offers “Fashion Rewards”—points

of points, they receive “Nordstrom
Notes,” which can be redeemed
against future purchases. Many
other stores around the world run
similar loyalty programs.

Online challenges
Retailers who exist online potentially
have more to gain from loyal
customers, but ﬁrst they have to
overcome the lack of an immediate
emotional connection provided by
the ambiance of a physical store.
For example, Zappos, the online
shoe seller, uses its call center to
forge relationships with customers

and win their loyalty. For founder
Tony Hsieh the call center is not a
running cost, but an opportunity
to market. Call center employees do
not read from scripts—they seek to
make an emotional connection with
customers. Their reputation for
going out of their way for customers
is now enshrined as part of the
brand. Simple tactics such as
sending goods ahead of schedule,
and a 365-day returns period, have
helped to build a repeat purchase
rate reported at about 75 percent.
CEO of Amazon Jeff Bezos
paved the way for the development
of customer satisfaction in the
digital era. Bezos was able to
overcome some of the potential
stumbling blocks of Internet
retailing, such as customers not
being able to touch the products
and having to wait for delivery, since
its customer service includes nextday delivery and free returns. The
company has consistently ranked at
the top of the American Customer
Satisfaction Index. As Bezos
asserts, “If you make customers
unhappy in the physical world, they
might each tell six friends. If you
make customers unhappy on the
Internet, they can each tell 6,000.” ■

Is the customer always right?

Customer loyalty and store cards
encourage repeat purchase of products
and also provide businesses with the
opportunity to gather data about their
customers’ shopping habits.

Department store owners Harry
Gordon Selfridge (1857–1947),
who founded Selfridges in
London in 1909, and Marshall
Field (1834–1906), who in 1865
started the store bearing his
name in Chicago, are both
credited with coining the phrase,
“the customer is always right,”
which has come to mean that it
is cheaper to retain a customer
than ﬁnd a new one. In an era of
overblown product claims it was
an approach designed to attract
the burgeoning middle classes.

However, since the 1990s,
marketers have adopted a more
discriminating approach to
customers in the belief that the
customer is not always right.
Each customer can be
measured by their individual
return on investment (ROI)
or lifetime value, allowing
customer-service efforts to focus
on the more proﬁtable patrons.
Using ROI, some businesses
differentiate between customers
who are always right and those
who are not worth listening to.

Business ethics—the moral

been an area of study since the
early 1900s. Early attention focused
on workers’ rights and conditions,
and whether they were paid a “fair

founding of the Fairtrade Foundation.
This introduced a labeling system
for products that had been produced
and traded without exploitation.
It gave consumers the ability to
choose products on ethical grounds
when making a purchase.
From the 1990s, as corporations
pursued globalization strategies and
increasingly outsourced production
to low-wage economies, consumers
became more aware of the issues
involved, and the implications of
their buying choices.
Unilever publicized its ethical

M

arketers often use the
offer of a free gift, prize,
discount, or bonus to
sway customers into buying
merchandise. This strategy is
known as “incentive marketing” or
“sales promotion.” It is commonly
used to launch a new product,
regenerate interest when sales
growth is ﬂat, or to help build the
company’s reputation or brand.
US industrialist William Wrigley
was a pioneer of incentives aimed
at encouraging purchases. In 1892
he started marketing his chewing
gum offering gifts, or “premiums,”
to successfully woo customers
away from the established brands.
It was a tactic he returned to often
to stimulate sales growth.

Push and pull
In modern marketing terminology,
Wrigley used “pull” incentives:
gifts or price reductions that
stimulate consumer demand, so
that retailers are forced to stock
more of the product. Marketers can
also use “push” incentives: these are
compensations targeted toward the

retailer or wholesaler, so that they
will, in turn, direct consumer
attention toward certain products.
Both push and pull incentives
can cause a short-term lift in sales,
but over time their impact wears off;
promotion fatigue sets in, or the
incentives become too expensive.
The success of a promotion is
measured by looking at return on
investment (ROI). When this begins
to fall, or the company’s reputation
suffers from a surfeit of promotions,
the strategy is no longer working. ■

n the corporate landscape
advertising is sometimes seen
as a waste of money, and
expenditure on it is often the ﬁrst
part of the budget to be cut back
during a recession. The point that
advertising executive Bruce Barton
(1886–1967) was making with his
much-quoted statement “In good

times people want to advertise;
in bad times they have to” is that
advertising should be employed as
part of an ongoing effort to build
relationships with existing and
prospective customers.

for some of the key American
advertising campaigns of the 1920s

through the 1940s, believed that
cutting advertising spend was
foolhardy. Instead he pointed out the
advantages of a continual presence
in the market through constant
advertising. To survive commercial
ups and downs, a business needs
to maintain a constant presence in
the mind of the consumer.
Barton believed that it is a false
economy to advertise only when
the market is booming and the
company has the budget for it, and
then to cut back when proﬁt
margins are reduced. If a company
withdraws from advertising, the
consumer may forget about them,
making it a tough job to win them
back later when the economy is
buoyant again.

Building a brand
Barton was not the ﬁrst to prize the
value of advertising in developing
an indelible image for a company or
product. Thomas Barratt (1841–1914),
sometimes dubbed the “father of
modern advertising,” created a
number of campaigns for the UK
soap maker Pears in the late 19th
century. These advertisements
helped make the brand synonymous
with soap. While owner Francis
Pears was extremely wary about
spending money on advertising,

Barratt, his son-in-law, was more of
a risk taker. He understood the
importance of staying in the public
arena and of constantly evaluating
changing tastes in the market.
An outstanding example of
image building through long-term
advertising is Nestlé’s Kit Kat. Most
people in the countries where this
slogan was used will probably be
able to ﬁnish the product’s tagline,
“Have a break—have a Kit Kat.” One
reason the slogan is so well known
in the UK is that it has been in use
since 1957, forming an important
part of the brand’s advertising and
marketing ever since.

Staying power
It could be argued that the company
that stops advertising risks
disappearing from the public
consciousness, perhaps even more
so today when most people are

lthough the catchphrase
is contemporary, the idea
of “generating buzz” is a
long-standing concept in sales. In a
sophisticated market populated by
savvy consumers who no longer
trust most of the messages
presented by advertisers, word-ofmouth marketing, or WOMM, has
become a vital tool for anyone in
business. The strategy is to use the
consumer’s own voice—the words
of the ordinary person—to do the
selling, rather than the voice of
the big brand or the omnipotent
mass communicator.
Back in 1973, Madison Avenue

your thinking as funny as possible.”

Spreading the message
In the 21st century, WOMM
strategies are predominantly used

marketers are able to purposefully
spark word-of-mouth campaigns
within online communities, but
they also understand the impact

humorous, quirky, and offbeat ideas
to get a reaction. Today, people still

information is easily spread.
Tactics to manipulate this trend
include guerrilla marketing, which
uses low-cost unconventional
methods with a surprise element
to provoke comment, and viral
marketing, which typically employs
social media to spread a brandsponsored video, or encourages
inﬂuential bloggers and others to
recommend products.
In The Tipping Point (2000),
British social commentator Malcolm
Gladwell outlines the power of
social epidemics and how the
smallest impetus can trigger a
mass phenomenon. According to
Gladwell, the title of his book refers
to a “magic moment when an idea,
trend, or social behavior crosses
a threshold, tips, and spreads like
wildﬁre.” This describes modern
“word-of-mouth” marketing,
though it originates in broader
ideas about how ideas replicate
in human culture. As Gladwell
explains, “ideas and products ...
messages and behaviors spread
just like viruses do.”

Kick-starting the process
Marketers can mimic this process
by encouraging customers or
inﬂuential members of online
communities to kick-start the
imitation process and become
“brand champions,” sometimes by
offering incentives in return for
reviews and recommendations.
Industries in which trends are
paramount for success are at the
forefront of WOMM online. Fashion
e-tailer ASOS utilizes Twitter and
Facebook to propagate customer
recommendations and provide
entertainment. In its 2011 “Urban
Tour” campaign, ASOS marketers
created videos showcasing the
world’s best street dancers and
in-line skaters. The videos enabled
click-through shopping and were
platform-neutral to ease their
spread on social-media channels.
Sneaker brand Nike has been at
the forefront of the trend, producing
videos with enough “wow” factor to
send them viral. The two-minute
“Touch of Gold” video (2008) featured
soccer player Ronaldinho showing
off his skills wearing Nike cleats. ■

Memes and imitation
In 1976 evolutionary biologist
Richard Dawkins put forward
the theory that, just as genes
are responsible for replicating
physical characteristics,
cultural information such as
ideas, behavior, or style, can
also be transferred from
person to person. Dawkins
referred to this cultural data
as “memes.” These memes,
like genes, can spread, mutate,
or die out in society. As
Dawkins describes it, “Just as
genes propagate themselves
in the gene pool by leaping
from body to body via sperm
or eggs, so memes propagate
themselves in the meme
pool by leaping from brain
to brain via a process which,
in the broad sense, can be
called imitation.”
Marketers have applied the
theory to online behavior. An
Internet meme can be a photo,
image, video, website, word, or
symbol, which originates from
a single user or group of users
and builds momentum when it
is imitated by other Internet
users. By piggybacking on
existing memes, brands can
gain massive exposure for
relatively little cost.

uses numerical data such as sales
patterns. Also in this category are
equations that make assumptions
about future sales by drawing
on a company’s historical data, and
market research that indicates the
number of potential customers for
a particular product or service. In
addition, marketers look at external
factors beyond the company’s
control, such as the state of the
economy, and make simulations of
how quantitative forecasts would
be affected by external factors.

Unforeseen circumstances
Even the most carefully planned
forecast can be thrown out by
unforeseen events. In the travel
industry, for example, it is difﬁcult
to predict performance because
factors such as weather and world
events have a signiﬁcant impact
on customer choices.
The effect of world events can be

Management consultant Peter
Drucker was scornful of forecasting.
“We must start out with the premise
that forecasting is … not worthwhile
beyond the shortest of periods,” he
wrote in Management: Tasks,
Responsibilities, Practices (1973). He
had reason to be wary, having
declared in a 1929 economic journal
that stock prices were bound to
keep rising, just a few weeks before
the Wall Street Crash. International
auditing company KPMG maintains
that most companies produce
unrealistic forecasts that can be off
by up to 13 percent on average.
According to KPMG, better data
management, scenario planning,
and forecasts that are continually
updated rather than made long-term
can increase accuracy. Despite the
difﬁculty of accurate forecasting, it
remains the primary means by
which marketers drive the business
decisions of a company. ■

Accurate forecasting

Shares on the stock market are
affected by many factors, including
some that are difﬁcult to predict—
such as world events, severe weather,
and global economic forecasts.

Producing an accurate forecast
depends on the company’s
required lead time—the time
from order placement to
customer delivery. The longer
the lead time, the greater the
error in forecasting ﬁgures. One
theory holds that if lead times
are reduced by 50 percent,
forecasting errors will also be
reduced by 50 percent.
Since the 1990s management
theorists, including Dr. Edmund
Prater at the University of Texas,
have advocated that forecasting

accuracy can be optimized by
creating a demand-driven supply
chain, which uses information
and technology to shrink lag
times between supply decisions
and actual demand. Thus the
need for forecasting is reduced
when business activities become
more demand driven. For
example, when Wal-Mart asked
stores to place orders every two
weeks rather than monthly,
inventories reduced because
accurate forecasting increased in
line with the shorter time frame.

Building the mix
Harvard Business School professor
Neil Borden ﬁrst coined the term
“marketing mix” in 1950, using it in
1953 in his presidential address to
the American Marketing
Association. Borden credited fellow
professor James Culliton as being
the ﬁrst to introduce the idea of the

ideas, Borden began using the term

The ﬁrst list includes ingredients

to win sales—product planning,
pricing, branding, distribution,

list includes market forces, such

as the behavior of consumers,
retailers, competitors, government

In Borden’s model, the
marketing manager should weigh
the effect of external forces, then
juggle the marketing elements from
the ﬁrst list to achieve the best
possible program to ﬁt the
resources of the company. Borden
advocated that to really get a grasp
of all the marketing considerations,
the manager should draw up a
chart showing the elements of the
marketing mix.
Both Culliton and Borden
inspired further development of
the concept within the academic
community. In 1960, a marketing
professor at Michigan State
University, Edmund Jerome
McCarthy, set out what would
become the deﬁnitive word on the
marketing mix. He condensed the
mix ingredients into an easily
remembered mnemonic, the Four

282 MARKETING MIX
The Four Ps, key ingredients of the marketing
mix, need to be in careful balance with each other
and the mix as a whole. Alternative “ingredients”
have been proposed as necessary components of the
marketing mix, but the core Four Ps have endured.

PRODUCT
Evaluate customer needs;
establish where and how the
product will be used; decide
on branding and packaging,
and how the product
will differ from others
in the market.

the channels of distribution;
methods of storage; handling
and transportation; and how

product or service for the target
market, whether it is a laundry
detergent, an accountancy service,
or a political party’s policy, and
also includes branding, packaging,
warranties, and anything else
related to the product offering.
“Place” refers to how the product
will get to the target market, so
it is available when and where it
is needed—in other words, the
channel of distribution and the
logistics of transportation, storage,

in the distribution chain—public
relations, advertising, sales
promotions, and so on. “Price”
includes price-setting based on
competition within the market, the
cost of the entire marketing mix,
and what price level the customer
will accept. If price is rejected then
the marketer’s efforts are wasted.

Other additions or alternative
mixes have been proposed, though
none has yet replaced McCarthy’s
original premise.
In the 1990s, for example,
advertising professor at the
University of North Carolina, Robert
Lauterborn, argued that the Four Ps
articulated the seller’s view rather
than the buyer’s view, and was
therefore outdated in the customercentered marketing of the late 20th
century. He reimagined the Four Ps
as the Four Cs: Customer solution,
Convenience, Communication,
and Customer cost.
Professors Jagdish Seth and
Rajendra Sisodia then posited
the Four As: Acceptability,
Affordability, Availability, and
Awareness. By 2005, academics
Chekitan Dev and Don Schultz
claimed that the Four Ps were no
longer relevant; that consumer
decisions were motivated by
emotion and a desire for value,
rather than for a speciﬁc product
to ﬁll a need or a particular price
point. Other commentators have
also pushed for a framework more
applicable to e-commerce. On the
other hand, Carolyn Siegel, author

In an industry such as fashion,

relying on the usual trade-show

Bench uses a more direct approach.
Sales people take samples to
retailers, and send orders directly
to headquarters while still with the
retailer. An automated system then
generates purchase orders to the
manufacturing site within hours.

Marketing pioneers
Neil Borden recognized the
importance of creating a
marketing methodology—
a set of stated intentions for
marketers to follow. When he
put forward his marketing mix
concept in 1953, he drew on
theories developed by earlier
marketing thinkers.
Ralph Butler, professor at
the University of Wisconsin,
pioneered the use of the term
“marketing” by developing a
course on selling called
“marketing methods” in 1910.
A few years later in 1915, H. W.
Shaw wrote Some Problems in
Marketing Distribution, in
which he identiﬁed the tasks
of production and distribution.
Paul Cherington and Paul
Ivey, among others in the
1920s, further consolidated
marketing as a ﬁeld of scholarly
pursuit, laying the groundwork
for marketing as a college
course in its own right. In the
1920s and 1930s, Paul Dulaney
Converse described key
elements of the marketing
mix—distribution, pricing, and
advertising—and emphasized
the need to coordinate
marketing activities.

arket globalization and
fast-paced technological
change have raised
customer expectations, and
companies can succeed or fail
depending on their ability to deliver
the right goods at the right price, at
the right time, via the right
distribution channels.
If getting it wrong can be costly,
getting it right takes time. It means
constantly evaluating every part of
the production process to see
where it can be made more efﬁcient
without a perceived drop in quality
or sales. Henry Ford was the ﬁrst
industrialist to recognize the value
of offering customers “more for
less,” and made it his business to
make improvements to his cars
every year, while simultaneously
dropping their price. Today, many
use a “low cost, good quality”
strategy to attract customers,
especially during times of recession.

Low-cost efﬁciency
One of the most effective ways of
lowering costs while maintaining
value is to reduce waste. Known as
“lean production,” it entails
identifying and cutting waste
across the process, from production
to delivery. Lean production
developed from the ideas of Joseph
Juran, a management consultant

who developed innovative ways of
improving quality and efﬁciency at
the same time. In the 1950s, the
Union of Japanese Scientists and
Engineers invited him to lecture to
hundreds of top-level executives,
who quickly put his ideas to
practical use. Toyota was among
the many businesses who
implemented his methods. The
company’s approach ultimately grew
into the “just-in-time” production
system that is widely used today.
Stock control plays a large part
in the “just-in-time” system, and is
vital to a balanced cash ﬂow. Too
much stock in the warehouse
represents money that is doing

nothing; if there is not enough stock
to meet demand, customers may
search out alternative suppliers.
Cost reduction is the holy grail
of production managers, and one
way to achieve this is to simplify
production methods. This involves
removing unnecessary and costly
steps, or innovating so that stages
become faster or less wasteful.
Entrepreneur Michael Dell saved
time and money by cutting out the
retailer and letting customers design
their own computers; these were
produced to order (“just in time”)
and sold directly to the end user.

Creativity and innovation
Innovation can come from any part
of the business. The Japanese idea
of kaizen—meaning continuous
improvement—is an ancient
philosophy, but it was ﬁrst used in
an industrial setting by Toyota in
the 1950s. Founder Elji Toyoda
expected all employees—from the
factory ﬂoor to senior executives—
to constantly come up with ideas
for improving products or production.
This idea took hold around the
world. Companies recognized value
in setting up teams to increase
creativity. However, large companies
often limit innovation—or at least
the testing of its validity—to an
R&D (research and development)

DELIVERING THE GOODS 287

department. They can focus on the
changing needs of markets and
respond appropriately, making sure
they beneﬁt from the premium
price of innovative products, and
build a brand loyalty.
More recently, companies have
also begun to value the creativity of
their customers. Using an approach
known as “open innovation,” new
ideas are welcomed from all sources,
and customer feedback is valued in
the product-development process.
The opportunity for customers to
post product ratings and reviews
online allows ready access to
customer feedback. Some even use
online crowdsourcing to reﬁne the
design of products.

The rise of “big data”
Computer systems can collect and
yield vast amounts of accurate data,
which can translate into valuable
information about employees,
production lines, and markets.
Data collected about customers
is often referred to simply as “big
data.” Customer buying preferences
and habits can now be tracked with
incredible accuracy—from their
movements around a website, to
where and how they like to buy
products and services, both online
and in stores. This gives an accurate
picture of their overall market, while

also targeting individual
customers, offering them products
in tune with their preferences.

The cost of quality
Companies aim to satisfy customers
to get repeat business and good
“word-of-mouth,” which can hugely
boost sales. Those that operate in
the fast-moving-consumer-goods
(FMCG) market, selling such things
as chocolate, beer, and cereals, rely
on quality for creating customer
loyalty. In the service industries,
following this “added-value”
approach can be problematic. If
competing companies raise the
quality of their product or service
to a level that would be unproﬁtable
to match, this would signal the
need for new strategic thinking.
However, high-quality goods
can last for a long time without
needing replacement, and this
was a problem addressed by
industrial designer Brooke Stevens.
He suggested that companies
could increase sales by creating
in consumers the “desire to own
something a little better, a little
sooner than necessary.” This seems
especially true today, when new
models of products such as
smartphones are produced
regularly—well before their
predecessors are defunct.

For a smooth, fast route to a highquality product, companies need to
make best use of time and resources.
This has led to the development of a
way of working known as “timebased management,” which involves
utilizing time in the same way as
raw materials. It is often used with
critical-path analysis, which
identiﬁes all the stages of a project
and puts them into a logical order,
saving companies time and money.
Finally, businesses can improve
processes and sales by observing
the best practice of competitors in
their ﬁeld, using a process known
as benchmarking, which takes the
“best from the best” so companies
can deliver the best products in the
best way to satisfy customers. ■

Improvement usually means
doing something that we have
never done before.

enry Ford spotted a gap in
the market for a massproduced car that ordinary
Americans could afford. The Model
T Ford was launched in 1908 and
was still selling well nearly 20 years
later. During this period, Ford
regularly improved the car. For
example, the ﬁrst version of the
Model T required the driver to crank

the engine by hand to start it, but
later models had an electric starter.
Ford did not opt to make customers
pay more for this better product. In
fact, he did the opposite. The price
of a Model T Ford fell every year
from 1909 until 1916. Ford saw the
importance of offering more for less.

customers by way of lower prices,
which helped to boost sales.
Successful companies are able
to attract customers by supplying
high-quality goods and services at
prices the buyer is willing to pay.
Companies such as Dollar Tree in
the US or Poundland in the UK base
their business model on offering
their customers as much as
possible for $1 or £1—for example,
in June 2013 Poundland launched
the world’s cheapest bra, which
retailed at £1. Offering more for
less can be an effective business
strategy, provided that the price
covers costs. Low prices that offer
excellent value for money attract
customers away from rivals.

More for less
Budget supermarket chains, such
as Lidl and Aldi in Europe, have
used this strategy to great effect.
These businesses have been able
to grow their market share at the
expense of larger supermarket
chains. Since the ﬁnancial crisis,

Lidl’s supermarkets are basic, with
a limited range of products, some of
which are displayed on warehouse
pallets. However, the products
themselves can be of a high quality.

inﬂation has regularly outstripped
pay raises, and households have
responded by seeking out retailers
that offer them more for less.
The secret to Lidl and Aldi’s
success is not solely due to their
low prices. They also offer highquality products. For example, in
2012, Lidl launched its own
designer aftershave called G.Bellini
X-Bolt for $6.35 (£3.99). In blind tests
the fragrance beat famous brand
names, such as Dior Homme, D&G
The One, and Hugo Boss Bottled,
which cost up to ten times more.
The stores focus on offering
good value stock rather than an
attractive shopping experience.
They offer products on pallets
direct from the warehouse, and do
not spend time or money displaying
their goods attractively. They also
do not stock popular brands that
shoppers will ﬁnd elsewhere; most
stock comes from less well-known
suppliers that the stores can obtain
at competitive prices.
The challenge for entrepreneurs
is to offer outstanding value for
money, while also keeping costs
low enough to trade proﬁtably. ■

The car manufacturer Hyundai
is the fourth-largest in the
world and the third-largest

South Korea. Its success is a
direct result of its policy of

One way Hyundai has
grown its market share
is by offering the longest
warranties in the auto
industry. Long warranties
are an obvious selling point,
because if a new car breaks
down during the warranty
period the buyer can return
it to the manufacturer, who
will repair it free of charge.
Hyundai’s warranties
guarantee the engine for ten
years, cover the bodywork
for seven years, and offer
free roadside assistance in
the event of a breakdown
for ﬁve years. Despite these
long warranties, Hyundai still
charges relatively low prices
for its vehicles.
Hyundai cars are also
well equipped. Features such
as Bluetooth connectivity,

visit Ford’s Rouge plant in Detroit,
MI. Toyoda spent three months
studying the mass-production
technique pioneered by Ford at the
Rouge. On his return, Eiji reported
that he was impressed by the scale
of production that Ford achieved—
the Rouge was so big that it
required its own railroad, hospital,
and several ﬁre stations. However,
he also believed that the factory
was riddled with muda—the
Japanese term for wasted effort,
materials, and time. Toyoda and his
colleagues set about developing a
new production system that sought
to replicate the output and
economies of scale achieved by
Ford, but in a less wasteful manner.

Seven types of waste
Shigeo Shingo, a Japanese
industrial engineer who worked
with Toyota in the 1970s, identiﬁed
seven types of waste, or muda.
The ﬁrst type is overproduction.
Traditional manufacturers have
a tendency to mass produce in
advance of sales. These companies
try to forecast what they think
demand will be for their product,
then they make the goods that they
expect to sell. The main problem
with this system of manufacturing,
however, is that it relies on accurate
forecasting of demand. If the
forecast does not accurately match
demand, the company could be left
with mountains of unsold stock.

The second example of muda
is inventory waste. In addition to
stockpiles of unsold ﬁnished goods,
many mass producers keep stocks
of raw materials and work-inprogress to reduce the risk of
production being halted. Stocks of
raw materials are held in case a
supplier fails to make a delivery, or
to protect against the possibility
that some of the raw materials
might be defective and unusable.
Stocks of work-in-progress, or semicompleted products, are held just in
case a machine on the production
line breaks down. These can then
be inserted into the process to
ensure that production continues.
However, holding stocks of raw ❯❯

addition, cash tied up in stock could be

materials and work-in-progress is
considered wasteful because of the
associated space and staff costs.
The third type of muda that
Shingo identiﬁed is movement. In
some factories, workstations are
badly designed, and employees
spend time doing things that do not
add value to the product, such as
Muri, mura, and muda are three
Japanese terms identiﬁed by the
Toyota Production System as
problems to avoid. Muri refers
to the overburdening of
individuals or teams, which
is inefﬁcient; mura means
an unbalanced work ﬂow,
which can cause
bottlenecks in supply;
and muda are all the
areas of waste
in a system.
MURA
Unbalanced

looking for tools, walking from one
part of the factory to another, or
bending to pick up parts. This type
of waste increases cycle time—the
time taken to produce a unit of
output. Longer cycle times lead to
lower productivity, which in turn
drives up unit labor costs.
The fourth muda is time spent
waiting. Delays may occur when
machines on a production line are
poorly coordinated, resulting in
bottlenecks. Time might also be
wasted resetting machinery to
produce a different part.
The ﬁfth muda is transportation.
Time and money spent moving
work-in-progress from one factory
to another will drive up costs, and
this is unlikely to add value to the
product, so it is wasteful.
The sixth example of muda is
overprocessing. Consumers will
only pay for the product features
that they value. Producing complex,
overengineered products is wasteful
because it creates additional costs
without any extra revenue.

The ﬁnal muda is the production
of defective items. Substandard
products signify waste of time and
resources, and mean that further
inspection processes are required
and the products must be reworked.
In addition to the seven types of
muda, Toyota identiﬁes two other
potential problems: mura and muri.
Mura is uneven ﬂow in a process,
leading to unbalanced working
practices. Muri is the overburdening
of people or equipment.

Lean strategy
Using these insights, production
engineer Taiichi Ohno developed
the Toyota Production System
(TPS). This lean production method
counters waste in the production
process by producing more using
less. It enables a manufacturer to
increase output without having to
pay for extra labor, raw materials, or
capital. Alternatively, a business
can use lean production techniques
to make a better-quality product
that will sell for a higher price.

MURI
Overburdened
JUST-IN-TIME

MUDA
Waste

A just-in-time supply system
eliminates muri, mura, and muda
from the production system, so that
teams receive materials as they
need them and waste is avoided.

DELIVERING THE GOODS 293
Lean producers try to eliminate
overproduction and waste stock by
using the just-in-time (JIT) system,
in which production only happens
in response to a customer order.
Companies that use just-in-time
never produce output for stock, and
if there are no orders from buyers,
production stops. Thus, production
is pulled through by the consumer,
rather than being pushed through
by the manufacturer. The same
principle is extended to raw
materials and bought-in components.
Lean producers run with minimal
buffer stocks, relying instead on
daily, or even hourly, deliveries from
suppliers. However, the absence of
a stock of raw materials means that
a faulty shipment of components
could bring an entire factory to a
halt. So to make just-in-time work,
lean producers require reliable
suppliers that produce zero defects.

Lead times
If products are to be made to order
rather than supplied from stock,
there is a risk that a long lead
time (the time between an order
being made and delivery to the
consumer) could result in customer
dissatisfaction and consequently
falling sales. Therefore, to run lean

production effectively, companies
need to shorten the cycle time
taken to make their products. To
accelerate the pace of production,
managers will need to control the
movement muda, the waiting muda,
and the transportation muda. At its
simplest, this could be achieved
by redesigning workstations and
production lines so that employees
have all the tools and components
to complete the task close at hand.
Likewise, bottlenecks in production
can be eliminated by deploying
more machinery or more labor at
the problem area.

Overprocessing
Lean producers tackle wasteful
overprocessing, the sixth muda,
by applying a process called value
analysis at the product design
stage. Companies using value
analysis attempt to identify product
features that create cost but have
no value for the consumer. If these
features can be removed to create a
simpler, cheaper product, proﬁt
margins will rise. At the same time,
revenues should not fall, because
the features that have been removed
were not valued in the ﬁrst place.
It could be argued that the
business model of a no-frills hotel,
as seen in the Malaysian company

Tune Hotels, is based on value
analysis. For Tune Hotels, affordable
rooms are its priority. To achieve
this, services that push up the price
of a room but are viewed as
nonessential by customers, such as
air-conditioning or toiletries, have
become optional add-ons. The chain
focuses solely on core qualitites
such as cleanliness and safety,
valued highly by the customer.
To eliminate the seventh muda,
defective products, lean producers
seek to create high-quality items.
This requires managers to trust
workers to spot any fall in quality.
Employees have the authority to
stop the production line in order to
solve the problem, and production
only restarts once the source of the
problem has been found and ﬁxed.
High product quality, achieved
by lean production, leads to lower
costs. By solving problems at their
source, companies spend less time
and money on reworking defective
products to bring them up to the
required standard. ■

Regardless of how much
workers move, it does not
mean work has been done.
Working means that progress
has been made.

ﬁnal product or to replace defective
materials. This strategy ensures that
production can continue in the
event of a delay from the supplier;
companies are more likely to hold
stocks of raw materials if their
supplier is unreliable. They may also
keep stocks of “work-in-progress,” or
semicompleted products. Work-inprogress stock can keep production
ﬂowing even if a machine on the
assembly line breaks down.

Stock control
Good stock management balances
meeting product demand with
minimizing stock-holding costs. If a
company runs out of stock, it may
have to turn orders away, or deliver
late and risk losing returning
customers. In 1993 toy manufacturer
Bandai was caught off guard by the
popularity of its Power Rangers
ﬁgures, and had to impose a “one
ﬁgure per customer” rule in the UK
until manufacturing could catch up
with the huge demand.
On the other hand, if a company
is overly cautious and holds too
much stock, it incurs unnecessary

costs: warehouse space is
expensive, and employees are
needed to manage it. It can also
lose value if it perishes or becomes
technologically obsolete. There is
also an opportunity cost associated
with holding stock; the cash tied
up in stock could be earning
interest, or be invested elsewhere.
The goal is to hold just enough
stock to meet demand, with
minimum delay to the customer and
at minimum cost to the company. A
sophisticated computer program at
McDonalds, called Manugistics,
helps the chain forecast sales and
ensure the correct quantity of stock
is ordered for the week ahead.

Buffer stock
Most companies hold buffer
stock—stock that exceeds the
amount needed to meet current
demand. It takes time to replenish
stocks, so companies will reorder
from suppliers well before their
inventory falls below the buffer
level. The longer the lead time—the
time between placing an order and
the goods arriving—the greater the

US inventor Steven J. Paley
states that it is easier to
innovate by adding complexity,
but the best results come
from simpliﬁcation.

T

here are several ways that
companies can improve
their proﬁts: they can
increase their revenue, reduce their
costs, or use a combination of both
methods. If the cost of producing
goods or services can be reduced,
without negatively impacting
revenue, total proﬁts will rise.
A good way to lower costs is to
simplify the method of production
by removing any expensive and
nonessential steps that will not
adversely affect the consumer’s
perception of the quality of the
product. More straightforward—
and therefore more cost-effective—
production methods have been a
goal for centuries. An early example

To reduce the price of their
products, companies may choose to
lower their production costs.

Simplifying the process
In the 1850s the production method
was simpliﬁed by the British
engineer Henry Bessemer. His
so-called Bessemer process did not
require crucibles. Instead, the
impurities generated from heating
Steelmaking was revolutionized by
Henry Bessemer’s new converter. It
raised the temperature of the iron so
that more impurities could be removed

of a process that was successfully
simpliﬁed is steel manufacturing.
During the Industrial Revolution,
huge quantities of steel were needed
to build bridges, ships, and railroads.
Steel was in short supply because it
was expensive to produce. In
Britain, steel had been made in
high-temperature, coke-ﬁred
furnaces since the 1740s. Small
quantities of iron were loaded into
small clay crucibles (containers that
withstood heat) and placed inside
the furnace. After three hours,
impurities were scraped from the
crucibles, leaving the steel behind.

■

iron to create steel were removed
from the metal by blowing air
through the iron during the
production process. Bessemer’s
simpler production method was more
fuel efﬁcient. As a result, the cost of
making steel fell from as much as
$97 (£60) per ton to $11 (£7) per ton.
In some cases, simplifying a
process can mean using different
materials. In 1946 in the US, James

Watson Hendry invented plasticinjection-molding technology, which
was used to produce one-piece
chairs and tables much more
cheaply than wood.

Mass production
In the early 1900s, Henry Ford
revolutionized manufacturing
by standardizing the method
used to make cars. Before Ford’s ❯❯

assembly line, cars were made by
teams of highly skilled craftsmen
who produced custom-made cars
using little more than hand tools.
The components used by early
manufacturers were usually
nonstandardized. This meant that
workers would spend time adjusting
components so that they could be
assembled. Ford removed this stage
by designing the world’s ﬁrst
standardized car. Mass production
of the Model T, made from a
standard set of components, began
in 1910 in Highland Park, Michigan.
Ford’s second great innovation
was the conveyor belt. In the past,
skilled workers had to move around
the factory locating raw materials,
components, and tools. In some
factories workers were hired to
push partially assembled cars from
one workstation to another. Ford
believed these were unnecessary
steps that could easily be removed.
People were taken out of the
production process and were
replaced by specialized machinery,
including a conveyor belt that took
the work to the worker. Each

Going direct to the buyer
employee was asked to perform
a single task, using the same tool,
over and over again. As a result,
there was no time wasted
searching for, picking up, and
putting down an array of tools.
Finally, Ford removed variety
from the production process. Each
Model T produced was identical;
Ford believed in simplicity of
product, even down to the paint
color, which speeded up production.
Time spent resetting and cleaning
machines between batches was
avoided. A standard product made it
possible to institute continuous-ﬂow
production, and the amount of time
taken to produce a car dropped from
over 12 hours to just over one and a
half hours.Ford’s decision to simplify
production by removing skilled labor
and time from the process enabled
him to produce his cars at a lower
cost, which he then used to reduce
the price, and that created a mass
market for the Model T.

of tools, which lay within easy reach.

model on gaining a cost advantage
over his rivals. He did this in two
ways. First, Dell specialized in
selling custom-made computers;
customers could design their own
machine, which Dell assembled in
response to a speciﬁc customer’s
order. Dell held virtually zero stock
and production was pulled through
by the buyer. The main advantage
of this just-in-time method was that
Dell no longer had to pay the costs
associated with storing stock.
When a product was ﬁnished, it
was sent straight to the customer.

In more recent times, computer
manufacturer Dell achieved
stratospheric rates of growth in the
1990s by streamlining its supply
chain. Michael Dell, the founder of
the company, based his business

Dell’s second cost advantage was
that, unlike other PC suppliers,
it did not sell its products to
specialized retailers; instead, it sold
directly to the consumer via the
Internet. This meant that the
company no longer had to lose
some of its proﬁt margin to third
parties. When Dell sold a computer
for $400, it received $400.
Eliminating retailers did not have
an adverse effect on Dell’s market
share. In fact, the reverse was true.
Most computer buyers preferred the
ﬂexibility of being able to build
exactly the sort of computer that
they wanted, and also appreciated
the convenience of home delivery.

Simple can be harder
than complex: you have to
work harder to get your
thinking clean.
Steve Jobs
US Co-founder of Apple (1955–2011)

DELIVERING THE GOODS 299
Dell computers were not sold by
computer retailers; instead they were
available directly from the manufacturer.
Dell took the bold step of cutting out
retailers to undercut the competition.

Dell’s simpliﬁed business model
delivered lower costs, enabling
the company to gain market share
by undercutting the prices charged
by rival computer suppliers.
The success of Dell’s model of
selling directly to consumers was
adopted by companies in other
industries. In 1996, Amazon, now
the world’s biggest online store,
began selling books online without
the need—or costs—of running
a bookstore.
However, since 2000 Dell has
lost ground to a revitalized
competition. Some companies
copied Dell’s idea to sell computers
directly to customers, while others,
such as Hewlett-Packard, were able
to nullify Dell’s price advantage by
making their production process
more efﬁcient. The resurgence of
Apple has also dented Dell’s market
share. Apple produces a range of
products to suit different budgets,
and also allows its customers to
make some adjustments to the
computer’s speciﬁcations.

Simpler services
Companies that sell services also
work to improve efﬁciency by trying
to remove unnecessary steps from
their production systems. Sometimes
these changes are needed to ensure

a company’s survival. For example,
in the past, many independent food
venues offered meals produced in a
traditional, labor-intensive manner,
cooked from scratch with fresh
ingredients. Some business chains,
looking to capitalize on the growing
demand for low-cost food, adopted
a simpler approach. They began to
serve food that had been bought in
a prepared state and simply heated
in a microwave in response to a
customer order. There was no need
for trained cooks, and no time spent
preparing fresh ingredients.
Removing these steps cuts costs
and enables the establishment to
offer lower prices to consumers
without losing proﬁt margins.
However, innovations such as
these can be cyclical. A rising
market for freshly prepared food has
led to new fast-food chains selling
meals prepared on the premises. In
the current climate, many companies
are looking to cut costs by
streamlining processes. But the
businesses most likely to survive
are those that can lower prices, but
not quality, for the consumer. ■

Simplicity—the art of
maximizing the amount of
work not done—is essential.

college in Texas in 1983,
but soon left to focus on his
computer business, which
he named PC’s Limited. Dell
opened his ﬁrst international

later, and in 1998 changed
the business’s name to Dell

it a public company and raising
$30 million. In 1992, Dell
became the youngest-ever
CEO of a Fortune 500 business

n business, waste is anything
that adds to a company’s costs
that does not create a higher
output level, or lead to improved
customer satisfaction. Any money
generated from a reduction in
waste can help a business grow by
improving its competitiveness.
Joseph Juran (1904–2008) was
born in Romania and moved to
the US when he was a child. He
became an expert in quality in
business after working at Western
Electric in the 1920s and being
trained in statistical sampling and
quality control. Juran identiﬁed
waste as a factor that undermined
proﬁt. He urged businesses to
constantly look out for opportunities
to reduce waste. For Juran, the best
way to do this was to improve
product quality and the reliability
of the production process.

Reducing waste
Waste in business ranges from
investing in expensive machinery
that does not meet the required
output level because it breaks down
regularly, to producing ﬁnished

products that fail internal quality
audits and are not good enough to
be sold. If waste of this type can be
reduced it should be possible to
raise output without having to hire
extra workers, spend more capital,
or buy in additional raw materials
and components.
According to Juran, lower costs
can help a company grow in two
ways. First, if average costs can be
decreased, the business could
choose to pass on the reduction by
lowering prices to consumers. For
example, if an initiative to reduce
waste leads to a 10 percent fall in
average costs, the management
could opt to cut its retail prices by
the same magnitude, and still earn
the same proﬁt margin. Cutting
prices can help a business grow:
undercutting the competition on
price is likely to attract market
share. Furthermore, even in
markets where there is little
competition, price cuts will make a
product more affordable. The lower
price will widen the brand’s appeal,
and potentially create growth by
enlarging the target market.

Reinvesting proﬁts

Volkswagen

used to produce each car by
investing in new cutting
machinery and by changing the
dimensions of the steel sheets to
reduce off-cut waste. In the paint
shop, the amount of paint used
to produce a vehicle was halved
by installing state-of-the-art
painting robots.
These savings meant that
Volkswagen could reduce their
prices. For example, the price of
a Golf Cabriolet was reduced by
approximately $10,600 in June
2013. Reductions like this
contributed to a 6 percent rise in
global sales by May 2013.

In 2012, Volkswagen announced
its intention to become the world’s
most environmentally friendly car
manufacturer by 2018. To achieve
this goal, the German company
set out to reduce waste during the
production process.
When cars are produced, sheet
steel is cut out to form parts of
the chassis. If this process if not
managed effectively, expensive
steel can end up being wasted
as off-cuts. The management at
Volkswagen achieved a 15 percent
reduction in the amount of steel

Reduced unit costs can help a
company to enlarge its proﬁt
margins. If such savings are not
passed on to the consumer, they
could be used to increase the proﬁt
earned from the company’s current
sales volume. The additional proﬁts
made from reducing wastage could
be reinvested into the business—
the goal being to increase sales and
to achieve growth. An efﬁcient way
to make use of the cash saved by
reducing waste might be to fund
a new advertising campaign.
Alternatively, companies might
reinvest a signiﬁcant proportion
of their proﬁts into scientiﬁc
research and new product
development. Theories about the
life cycle of products, technological
advances, and changing consumer
tastes suggest that most products
have ﬁnite selling lives in the
market. If these investments pay
off, the next generation of products
will incorporate the latest musthave features and beneﬁts that will
appeal to consumers and translate
into high sales. ■

1997 Japanese founder of the
Kaizen Institute, Masaaki Imai,
writes Gemba Kaizen, stressing
that kaizen works best when
factory-ﬂoor workers provide
ideas for ongoing improvement.

I

n Japan, kaizen is an ancient
idea that has become part of
the culture. In its everyday
usage, the word means an
enhancement or a change for the
better. In a business context,
kaizen is more of a philosophy;
according to the kaizen way of
thinking, companies should strive
to increase efﬁciency through a
process of continuous improvement.
The majority of kaizen advances
are built around people and their
ideas, rather than investment in
new machinery. Employees use
kaizen to produce hundreds of
new ideas every year, aimed at
improving the efﬁciency of the
business. In isolation, each kaizen
idea might only have a marginal
effect on productivity and general
efﬁciency, but together these
changes add up, creating a critical
competitive advantage. Ideas for
continuous improvement should
come from all quarters—from
managers and employees alike.

The Toyota Way
Kaizen was ﬁrst deployed on an
industrial scale by car manufacturer
Toyota in the 1950s, as part of the
now famous Toyota Production

Toyota
The Toyota Motor Company
(TMC) was established in 1937. It
produced several models of sedan
cars at its Honsha production plant
following business precepts set
down by founder Sakichi Toyoda,
which included, “Always strive to
build a homelike atmosphere at
work that is warm and friendly.”
Following World War II, the
company faced a ﬁnancial crisis
and, for the ﬁrst time in its history,
had to layoff employees. In 1951,
Toyota implemented a creative
ideas suggestion system based on

do something, try it.
Sakichi Toyoda

System (TPS). This system was
designed to reduce muda—the
Japanese word for waste. One of
the forms of muda identiﬁed by
Toyota was wasted employee
talent; Eiji Toyoda wanted more
from his work force than just blind
obedience and hard work. At Toyota
employees were valued and
trusted—so much so that the
company expected their factoryﬂoor workers to ﬁx problems
associated with quality, and come
up with ideas to improve efﬁciency.
According to the Kaizen Institute,
founded by Masaaki Imai to
implement the philosophy, the goal
of any kaizen plan should be to
the principles of kaizen. This,
along with its principles of
“customer ﬁrst” and “quality
ﬁrst,” helped the company
thrive, and they began exporting
their ﬁrst cars to the US in 1957.
In 1962 management and
unions signed a joint declaration
stating that their relationship
should be based on “mutual
trust and respect.”
By 1999 production in Japan
had reached 100 million
vehicles. Today the company
continues to be guided by the
twin pillars of continuous
improvement and teamwork.

persuade all workers that they have
been hired for two jobs—doing
their job, and then looking for
ways to do it more efﬁciently.
Gemba is a Japanese word
meaning “the real place,” in a
business context gemba refers to the
place where value-added is created.
Kaizen is founded on the conviction
that the production-line worker is the
gemba expert who knows where the
problems are. Therefore, most of the
ideas for kaizen change should come
from the factory-ﬂoor workers,
rather than from management. This
is because difﬁculties and
abnormalities can only be analyzed
and ﬁxed at the gemba, not from
the desk. Kaizen philosophy
recognizes that a company’s
greatest resource is its employees.

Quality circles
Kaizen is more likely to be effective if
workers are asked to work as teams,
rather than as isolated individuals.
The process of coming up with good
ideas and solutions is often the
product of the synergy created by
people that have different skill sets,
qualiﬁcations, or ways of seeing the
world. Working as a team on kaizen
projects is known as being part of a
“quality circle.” The quality circle
consists of a group of people who
usually work together—for example,
on the same part of an assembly
line—as well as individuals from
other parts of the business who can
bring different perspectives. For
example, an engineer could provide
advice on technical matters, while
sales-team members can give the
group an insight into the customer’s
point of view.
In 1964, Toyota established
quality circles at its factory in
Toyota City, Japan. The quality

circles still meet regularly, at least
once a week, to discuss any of the
problems they have noticed on their
section of the production line. Each
morning employees are expected
to attend an asa-ichi (morning)
meeting with a positive attitude,
before the regular working day
begins. At this meeting they

One of the main tools used by
Toyota’s quality circles to generate

diagram. This is a graphic device
that uses the outline of a ﬁsh
skeleton to plot all the various
aspects of a problem and then

to identify possible causes for

Japanese companies do not
tend to give cash bonuses to
workers in return for their ideas. In
order for kaizen to be truly effective,
workers must feel a sense of pride
and fulﬁllment when contributing
their suggestions. New employees
are told when they start working
with the company that kaizen is an
expectation: an everyday part of
company life. In businesses that
use kaizen successfully, employees’
commitment to contributing ideas
is usually secured via programs of
job enrichment, which tend to
produce high levels of employee
motivation. According to
motivational theorists such as
Frederick Herzberg, workers enjoy
problem solving, decision making,
and the opportunity to advance
and grow psychologically while
at work. Therefore, it follows that
workers should enjoy taking part

in kaizen improvements and,
consequently, ﬁnancial bonuses
should not be necessary.

Empowerment
One way managers empower their
workers is giving them the authority
to make decisions that affect their
working lives. Empowerment is
more far-reaching than delegation,
which merely involves giving
permission for an employee to
perform a speciﬁc task. An
employee who is empowered has
been given the freedom to decide
what to do and how it should be
done. Empowerment is essential to
any kaizen program because it
enables good ideas from the
factory ﬂoor to be implemented
immediately. Once the kaizen
philosophy is in place, good ideas
and their subsequent
improvements should keep on
ﬂowing through—the number of
ideas made every week increases
because workers are able to observe
the effects of their own solutions.
To work effectively, kaizen requires
a business culture where trust,

loyalty, and mutual respect exists
between the management and the
work force. This avoids a potential
downside to the philosophy: the
fact that in a market where sales
are ﬂat, employee ideas that lead to
an increase in productivity could
represent a threat to jobs. Workers
are hardly likely to discuss laborsaving or cost-cutting measures if
they are talking themselves out of
a job. In many Japanese companies
the kaizen culture used to
incorporate a promise from the

management that workers would
have a job for life with the company.
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s
this was the case at Sony. During
economic downturns, when sales
fall, most companies try to protect
their proﬁt margins by making
layoffs that are designed to cut
costs. Sony rejected this approach
because it felt that laying off its
own workers would break the bond
of trust needed to make kaizen
work. According to Sony’s

In the fall of 1984, following
US concerns at the growing
dominance of the Japanese car
industry, the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT)
undertook a ﬁve-year, $5 million
research program into the global
car industry. The study produced a
new way of looking at production,
a new buzzword, and a best-selling
book—The Machine That Changed
the World, authored by James
Womack, Dan Jones, and Dan Roos.
The study conﬁrmed the US car
industry’s worst fears; Japanese car
producers led the way in terms of

minimizing the assembly hours per
car, the amount of stock held, and
the assembly defects per 100 cars.
The book attributed Japanese
success to a process called “lean
production”—a vital component
of which was kaizen.
Managers that had read The
Machine That Changed the World
tried to incorporate the kaizen way
of thinking into their business
model, and gradually the kaizen
philosophy spread to North
America and Europe. One of the
early British adoptors was Rover.
Under the guidance of Honda, who
at the time held a 20 percent stake
in Rover, the company introduced
gemba walks at its Longbridge
factory in 1991. Under Rover’s
gemba program, managers,
supervisors, and assembly-line
workers walked along the production
line together, at least once a week,
in order to look for inefﬁciencies,
and to ﬁnd solutions to the
problems they had identiﬁed.
Gemba walks were designed ❯❯

to remove the divide between
managers and workers, the
underlying philosophy being
that managers, supervisors, and
assembly-line workers should
learn, discover, teach, grow, and
make improvements together.

Kaizen in action
One of the ﬁrst British companies
to adopt quality circles was the
pottery company, Wedgwood. From
1980 onward, 80 quality circles
representing different parts of the
business met for an hour a week.
Each quality circle was empowered
to identify its own problem, which
it then spent up to six months
solving. The solution devised by
the circle was presented to the
management and most were
approved and then implemented.
Employee motivation improved,
which increased productivity. In
addition, employee ideas reduced
costs by cutting the amount of
clay and paint wasted during the
production process. According to
Dick Fletcher, the man who led
Wedgwood’s quality circle program,

for every $1.60 (£1) the business
spent on quality circles,
Wedgwood’s costs fell by $4.85 (£3).
Another business that has
employed kaizen techniques to
good effect is India-based Tata
Steel. The company made
improvements to the productivity of
its gear-cutting machinery, which
led to increased production.

The antithesis of kaizen
A very different approach from
kaizen is Business Process
Reengineering (BPR). This is based
on infrequent—but very capitalheavy—investment programs that
are designed to create a great leap
forward in terms of productivity,
reductions in unit costs, or
improvements in product quality.
Unlike kaizen, companies that use
BPR do not endeavor to make
regular small changes. Instead the
goal is to radically rethink the
whole production process every ﬁve
years or so to make it more efﬁcient.
Typically, this is in response to

OUTPUT PER WORKER (PRODUCTIVITY)

The effects of kaizen and BPR on
productivity are shown here over a
30-year time span. Overall, kaizen
increases output with consistent steady
improvements while BPR brings a series
of sharper boosts to productivity
followed by periods of ﬂat growth.

Investment in robots in the

can alienate the work force.

a period of stability follows, until
complacency sets in again, and the
next crisis arrives, and prompts
another round of BPR.
Rather than approaching
employees for ideas that lead to
improvements in efﬁciency,
companies that use BPR only use
ideas that originate from managers
and highly qualiﬁed consultants.
The work force is relatively passive:
change is imposed from the top
and often includes large-scale
layoffs. This is because companies
that use this approach often try to
boost efﬁciency by investing in
automated production systems that
replace labor with capital. Those
that favor kaizen argue that it is
better to try to improve efﬁciency
by making small but regular
changes, rather than by instigating
less frequent but more radical BPR
changes. In competitive markets,
companies that rely on BPR
struggle to match the less dramatic
but steadier growth achieved by
kaizen. Companies using BPR can

DELIVERING THE GOODS 309
be slow to catch up because during
the time it takes to develop, install,
and test new systems, companies
using kaizen have moved on,
boosting productivity to an even
higher level. This may be seen as
analagous to the fable by Aesop
in which the plodding tortoise
trumps the sprinting—then
delaying—hare. Increased
productivity achieved by kaizen
tends to be cheaper to obtain than
productivity growth achieved by
BPR. The source of kaizen
improvement is people. Employee
ideas are essentially free, unlike
expensive new machinery for a
new production system.

Is kaizen always effective?
However, in some companies
kaizen does not work. Middle
managers and supervisors who are
inclined toward an autocratic
leadership style typically resent
kaizen: they enjoy making all the
decisions and are sometimes

resistant to change. Individuals
with this mind-set will not want to
delegate decision making to factoryﬂoor workers. If their good ideas are
constantly ignored by managers,
employees will quickly become
disillusioned and stop contributing.
A company’s industrial relations
history can also affect the outcome
of kaizen. In general, the chances of
success with kaizen fall if there is a
lack of trust between the
management and the work force.
Employees may see kaizen in a
cynical way—feeling that the plan is
just another management ruse to
get more out of the work force
without offering anything in return.
Kaizen is built on the premise
that no production method is perfect;
systems can always be improved
through employee suggestions. But
is this always true? Logically,
businesses will try to use kaizen to
ﬁx key problems ﬁrst. It could be
argued that, over time, the beneﬁts
of kaizen are likely to fall steadily as

any new problems that are tackled
will be those previously considered
less signiﬁcant.

The rewards of risk
Technology and consumer tastes
change. From time to time the
old product, and with it the old
methods of production, will need to
be discarded in favor of something
new and radical. Companies that
favor kaizen may tend to eschew
radical overhauls in favor of less
dramatic change. The danger here is
that they can end up being left
behind by their bolder rivals. A good
example of a company that suffered
as a result of this approach is Nokia.
For many years the Finnish
cell-phone company enjoyed great
success by sticking to its classic
design of “Candybar” phones.
However, in the meantime rival
companies such as Samsung and
Apple took greater risks, and as
a result, out-innovated Nokia,
taking away their market lead. ■

Aesop’s fable tells how the
tortoise wins a race against
the hare by slowly advancing to
the ﬁnish while the hare sprints
and then riskily naps. Kaizen
can be viewed as the tortoise,
making minor adjustments
daily, while the hare can be
viewed as BPR, making rapid,
dramatic changes.

The tortoise
demonstrates that
steady progress,
such as that
achieved using kaizen
methods, can be the
better approach to
winning the race.

The hare’s
overconﬁdence
causes him to lose the
race, much as the big,
bold changes wrought
by BPR can prove
less effective in
the long run.

To innovate for the future, companies must be willing to learn

R

esearch and development
(R&D) is any investigative
and creative work intended
to lead to new discoveries or to
improvements in existing products

areas such as computer software
and pharmaceuticals, depend on
scientiﬁc research to bring about

technological breakthroughs and
keep themselves on the cutting
edge of their industry. Others apply
R&D to improve existing products.

Filling a gap
In some cases, the direction of
R&D is driven by market research

market, as it did for the cereal
manufacturer Kellogg’s. Market
research showed that there was
a desire in the UK for a sweeter
breakfast cereal made from nuts,
which people perceived to be
healthy. To meet this need,
Kellogg’s instructed its R&D
department to design a new
breakfast cereal; the result was
Kellogg’s Crunchy Nut, which
has become the second most
popular cereal in the UK.
There have been some cases
in which market research pointed
companies in the wrong direction.
A prime example can be seen in
the creation of Sony’s Walkman.
This portable audio cassette player
was invented in 1978 by Nobutoshi
Kihara, an audio engineer working
for Sony. According to market
research, the Soundabout (the
name for the prototype Walkman)
would never sell because focus
groups declared that listening to
music was a social rather than a
solitary activity. However, Akio

R&D department to continue its

work and ignore these ﬁndings.
The Walkman went on to be one of
Sony’s most successful products.

More products, more often
Intense competition resulting from
globalization, alongside rapid
technological advances, has
shortened the selling lives of many
products. To stay in business in
this tough trading environment,
companies need to launch new
products more regularly; those that
are complacent and fail to innovate
will be overtaken by their rivals.

■

It could be argued that managers
who do not invest in R&D are
setting up businesses to fail.
Companies such as BMW
devote a sizable percentage of their
turnover to R&D for motives that
extend beyond self-preservation.
Those that launch a new product
ﬁrst can charge premium prices
and will beneﬁt from monopoly proﬁt
until the competition arrives. In
addition, consumers’ brand loyalties
are usually established early on.
Companies that underinvest in R&D,
ﬁne to imitate rather than innovate,
may have problems establishing a
strong customer base.
There is more to effective R&D
than spending money on technical
breakthroughs. According to Akio
Morita, converting these advances
into products that provide value and
beneﬁts for consumers is more
important than the breakthrough
itself. Therefore, it makes sense
for R&D to be done by a multidisciplinary team that includes
a representative from marketing,
who understands the way the
consumer’s mind works. ■

The global positioning system

Satellites orbiting the Earth are
able to provide data on time and
location to a variety of GPS receivers
based on or near the planet.

Global positioning system (GPS)
technology was developed by the
US government during the 1960s
and 1970s to enable the US Navy
and Air Force to get an accurate
geographical ﬁx on submarines
and aircraft.
In 1983, US President Reagan
decided to give businesses
access to GPS so that they could
use it for commercial purposes.
A number of companies saw the
opportunities in this and began
designing GPS satellite navigation
systems for motorists.

GPS is an excellent example of a
revolutionary, technology-driven
innovation. However, in practice,
most new product innovations
are based on tweaking existing
products to make them better.
Companies such as TomTom,
who make GPSs, use R&D to
achieve evolutionary, rather
than revolutionary, product
development. The goal is to
launch new products every
year that are cheaper and better
designed, and that have new
updated features.

n the past, companies required
their own employees to design

knowledge was developed internally
by the in-house research and
development (R&D) department, and
tended to be a closely guarded
secret. This belief that a company
should be in sole control of the
creation of its intellectual property is
known as closed innovation. In more
recent times, a new approach has

emerged. Open innovation is based
on the idea that companies should
be less private with their productdevelopment programs, reﬂecting
the view that its customers can
make valuable contributions to the

ratings and reviews allow companies
to see what their customers like
and dislike about a product.
In the IT industry, companies
such as Apple and Microsoft use
beta testing to enhance the quality
of their new products. This process
involves the software developer
prereleasing copies of new software
via the Internet. Members of the
public who are interested in
software and programing have the
opportunity to road test the new
product. They might point out bugs
they encounter and offer possible
solutions to the problems they have
identiﬁed. The developer has the
opportunity to improve the software
before it is released, increasing the
probability of the new product
succeeding in the marketplace.

Crowdsourcing
The belief that companies can, and
should, learn from their customers is
growing. One example is the rise of
crowdsourcing—a practice where
companies get ideas, or even ﬁnance
for a new product (crowd funding),
from the public. There are different

types of crowdsourcing. For
example, some independent
ﬁlmmakers ﬁnance their movies as
crowdsourcing projects. Carmakers
such as Citroën and Nissan have
used crowdsourcing to enable car
buyers to contribute ideas for the
kind of product features that should
be built into new vehicles. Citroën
ran its crowdsourcing project via a
Facebook app. Members of the
general public were free to join the
Facebook group—called C1
Connexion—and add their thoughts
on six key aspects of the new car’s
design, including the number of
doors, the color of the interior, and
the equipment speciﬁcation. Citroën
kept its promise to build the car in
line with the preferences expressed
via the Connexion Facebook app.
There are several advantages to
incorporating positive and negative
feedback from members of the public
and customers into the productdevelopment process. The most
obvious is that it is very cheap. In
many cases companies do not pay
for the ideas and opinions of
crowdsourcers; interested volunteers

If cash is offered in exchange for
feedback, the amounts tend to be

as part of the product-development

are not on the payroll, but who have
valuable ideas and knowledge that

project, meaning that everyone
with access to the Internet is
able to write or make changes to

Instead, the project is ﬁnanced

Many of these supporters argue
that Wikipedia is superior to
conventional encyclopedias
because, unlike them, articles

includes sales data collected from
credit or debit cards swiped at
checkouts; web-browsing histories

Netﬂix knew from its “big data”

heavily downloaded. “Big data” was
also used to make production
decisions, including choosing
director David Fincher. Fans of
House of Cards also enjoyed
watching Kevin Spacey movies, so
he was cast in the lead role. ■

Internet cookies
Sales ﬁgures are an excellent
example of “big data.”
US online retailer Amazon

text ﬁles saved in a customer’s

what kind of items each of its
customers are interested in.
This information is used to
send recommendations that
are likely to appeal to the
customer, and so are likely
to create additional sales for
the company.
Cookies are used to create
a unique ID that stores the
customer’s name, address,
and credit-card number on the
hard drive of their computer.
When a customer returns to
the website, the ID stored on
the customer’s computer is
sent back to the business,
which enables it to identify
the customer and greet him or
her by name. The ID also
enables the online retailer to
recall the customer’s address
and credit-card details quickly,
speeding up the transaction
and increasing customer
satisfaction with the site.

High-quality
components and
design...

T

here is an adage that
quality sells, and many
companies believe that the
best way to attract buyers is to
produce a superior product.
Businesses that put quality ﬁrst
believe that the other factors
affecting demand, such as
promotion, distribution, and the
price, are much less important than
the product itself.
At ﬁrst this approach may seem
irrational. In some markets, after
all, low prices are critical. For
example, Ryanair’s competitive
advantage over its rivals is based
on its low-cost business model,
which enables the airline to charge
lower fares than its rivals. Yet some
low-cost goods or services can
represent a false economy for
customers, especially if the goods
are of poor quality, necessitating
extra costs for the customer to
repair or replace them.
Another possible way to boost
revenue is to increase the volume
of goods sold. Some companies
attempt to achieve this goal by
using advertising campaigns to
steal market share from their rivals.
However, the problem with trying
to grow revenue through promotion

...plus added value
that the customer was
not expecting...

is that it is usually expensive. In
the UK, for example, in 2013 a
30-second television commercial
cost up to $80,000 (£50,000).
Offering a quality product is
an alternative to these low-cost
or high-volume approaches. This
strategy can achieve the same
goal of boosting a company’s
revenues, improving customer
retention by offering clients a
product of a high standard that
they will want to keep or to buy
again and again.

What is quality?
To appreciate the role played by
quality, it is ﬁrst necessary to
understand what is meant by this
term. In a manufacturing context,
quality is achieved when a
company is able to supply reliable,
durable goods that meet or surpass
consumer expectations and are
free of defects.
High-quality products inspire
trust. Take, for example, highquality car tires. They often have
deeper treads than poor-quality
tires, making cars that have them
less likely to skid in emergencies or
bad conditions. In this case the
quality of a car tire could be the

difference between life and death.
Superior-quality tires, made from
harder-wearing rubber compounds,
also last longer than tires of lesser
quality, which means that the
driver will not have to face the cost
and inconvenience of replacing
them as frequently.
Great quality is not just about
using the best components. Design
is also crucial to achieving a
superior-quality product, because
design can offer the consumer new
beneﬁts for which they are willing
to pay a price premium. In 2011
the Japanese tire manufacturer
Bridgestone launched its new range
of ﬂat-run tires, based on an
innovative design that enabled
motorists to run a car with a ﬂat tire
for 50 miles (80 km) at a speed of
50 mph (80 kph). This feature enabled
drivers to reach the closest garage to

Quality wins out
Estée Lauder adopted the “quality

her cosmetics business in New
York in 1946. When she was a
child, her mother had lectured her
relentlessly on how exposure to the

sun led to premature aging of the
skin. The young Lauder took note
and began making her own skin
creams with her uncle, a chemist.
Like many other successful
entrepreneurs, Lauder genuinely
believed that there was a need for
her product, and in 1935 she began
selling her ﬁrst preparations: superrich, all-purpose crème; crème
pack; cleansing oil; and skin lotion.
In the beginning Estée Lauder
did not use any advertising; she
thought her products were so good
they would sell themselves. She
relied on her customers to promote
the products. Customers would try
her preparations, like them, and
continue buying them. Furthermore,
they would then recommend Estée
Lauder’s products to their friends.
She gave this form of promotion a
name: tell-a-woman marketing.
In more recent times, Samsung
has also used the quality-led
approach to great effect. The South
Korean electronics manufacturer
does not rely on glitzy advertising
campaigns to create its competitive
advantage. Instead, it appeals to a
market segment who favors product
quality over brand image.
In April 2013 the Samsung
Galaxy 4 was launched. Very
quickly it gained market share over
the market leader—Apple’s
iPhone—because it was seen as a
more technologically advanced
product than Apple’s latest model,
the iPhone 5. The display offered
around 100 more pixels per inch
than the iPhone 5, and its built-in ❯❯

camera also surpassed the iPhone 5
in terms of functionality and pixels.
In addition, according to research
by the UK consumer magazine
Which?, the Samsung processor
was nearly twice as fast as that in
the iPhone.
Samsung’s prices were slightly
lower than Apple’s, but there were
other producers of Android mobile
phones that substantially undercut
Samsung’s prices without taking
any of its market share. The key to
Samsung’s Galaxy 4 success was
its superior quality.

Brand loyalty
Quality can be an important selling
point even for low-cost products,
since it helps build brand loyalty
and thus ensures repeat customers.
In markets for fast-moving consumer
goods (FMCGs), manufacturers use
superior product quality to preserve
and extend their customer base.
FMCGs are nondurable products,
such as beer, toothpaste, chocolate,

and breakfast cereal, that are
bought frequently by households
and consumed immediately. Since
FMCGs are purchased regularly
throughout the year, the sales
volumes achieved by a successful
product can be immense.
A good example of an FMCG
market is the one for toilet paper.
According to research by US
toilet paper manufacturer Charmin,
126 billion rolls of toilet paper
are bought every year in the US.
In a market this large, even a
small share will translate into
multimillion-dollar revenues. If
consumers habitually purchase
the same brand of a particular
product over and over, rather
than switching between rival
brands, their brand loyalty will
be invaluable.
High-quality brands are more
likely to win brand loyalty than
brands of an inferior quality. For
example, households are more likely
to buy Charmin toilet paper again

and again if the product is softer
and stronger than the brands sold
by its rivals, generating higher
volumes of sales and greater
revenues. This means the business
has increased its revenues without
having to pay any of the marketing
costs usually associated with
acquiring customers.

Service and quality

Even a small
market share of these
repeat-buy, low-cost
items will represent
vast proﬁts.

Consumers tend to
stick with their
favorite brands of
fast-moving consumer
goods (FMCGs), which
are bought regularly.

Household items such as toothpaste, toilet
paper, and laundry detergent represent low-cost,
high-volume items that are bought regularly and
generate huge revenues for manufacturers.

Another indicator of good quality
is providing a service in a manner
that exceeds customer expectations.
This might manifest as efﬁciency,
or rapid response to customer
concerns. The Zurich Insurance
Group operates in over 170
countries and each month handles
over 600,000 customer interactions
via phone, mail, and the Internet.
Its ambition is to be the best global
insurer as measured by customers,
employees, and shareholders, and it
actively pursues quality assurance.
Its iQuality program sets out how
employees can pay more attention
to customers, and ﬁnd out more
about their changing needs and
expectations. It performs regular
checks on the quality of employees’
work and uses extensive market
research to gain feedback on
customer experience.

DELIVERING THE GOODS 323
Hotel guests are pleasantly surprised
to discover luxury extras that they
were not expecting. These could be
complimentary services or products.

Zurich also has protocols for
reacting to unhappy customers;
when several customers complained
that payment was too slow when
their policies matured, Zurich used
the “ﬁve whys” to discover that the
problem lay in a delay in sending
out claim forms. The company put
in an automatic system to send out
the forms 10 days before policies
matured, resulting in a 78 percent
drop in complaints. Zurich has won
many service awards, including two
“Five-star Service Awards” based
on 25,000 completed questionnaires.

Added value
Businesses can also create highquality products by adding value.
Value added is the difference
between a product’s price and the
raw material cost of making the
product. Companies can add value
to their products with new features,
innovative functions, or add-ons
designed to beneﬁt, and appeal
to, actual and potential buyers.
In the hotel business, Ibis adds
value by promising customers that
their specially designed beds,
mattresses, comforter, and pillows
will give them a better night’s
sleep. The cost of these items is
balanced against improvement in
retention of customers, or by higher
prices that create extra revenue.

Other hotels have been even bolder
in pursuing value added. In the
premium segment of the market,
hotels create additional value by
redeﬁning their core function.
These hotels do not just sell a
comfortable place to sleep; they sell
an “experience,” in which guests
are offered a range of “delighters”—
aspects of the hotel’s service that
delight the guest, but which are not
usually expected. Examples include
HD televisions; branded, high-end
shower gel and shampoo; free
champagne; and free slippers that
guests can take home with them.
Adding value is a constant
battle because a “delighter” can
soon become an expectation. If a
hotel fails to meet the constantly
rising requirements of its guests,
it will lose customers to its rivals.
Successful hotels are constantly on
the lookout for new “delighters” that
will surprise their guests without
becoming too expensive. Low-cost
delighters are the ideal way to
create value added, generate repeat
purchases, and ultimately produce
healthy proﬁts. ■

Quality ... is not what the
supplier puts in. It is what the
customer gets out and is
willing to pay for.
Peter Drucker
US management guru (1909–2005)

W. Edwards Deming
William Edwards Deming was
born in 1900 in Sioux City, IA.
He studied physics at the
University of Wyoming before
going on to receive a PhD from
Yale. After leaving full-time
education he worked for Bell
Telephones, where he was
part of a team working to
improve quality control.
One of his key ideas was
that the quality of bought-in
raw materials and components
matters more than their price
because their quality will be a
major factor in determining
the quality of the ﬁnished
product. Consequently, he
argued, manufacturers should
not choose their suppliers
solely on the basis of the price
charged. Ideally, companies
should try to develop a
long-running relationship with
a single supplier, which is
based on trust. This approach
would be more likely to lead to
better-quality materials.
In addition, Deming also
believed that quality came
from a production process that
was stable and consistent.

Updated styling
US industrial designer Brooke
Stevens deﬁned the term “planned
obsolescence” as instilling in
consumers “the desire to own
something a little better, a little
sooner than necessary.” The
strategy of planned obsolescence
was originally developed by General
Motors, who realized that advancing
technology would adversely affect
its future business. During the
1950s, it began updating the
styling of radiator grills, taillights,
and bodywork every few years to
encourage drivers to replace their
cars more often.
Over the last 30 years, as
technology has advanced, cars have
become even more durable and
reliable. Today, new cars are built
to last. With regular servicing the
engine and transmission of a new
car will still provide reliable service
for over 250,000 miles (402,000 km).
Typically, with average usage, this
equates to an expected useful life
of more than a decade. If drivers
only replace their vehicle once
every ten years, this would lead to
low sales for car manufacturers.
To generate higher sales levels,
many carmakers now set out to

the popularity of Samsung’s Galaxy

the S-Translator, which enables the

Status anxiety
speed up replacement purchase, by
giving cars regular face-lifts. The
redesigns are intended to encourage
status-conscious motorists to ditch
their still perfectly good vehicles for
the latest body shape.

New features
Car manufacturers also employ
various other tactics to persuade
consumers to update their vehicles.
New car models incorporate
cutting-edge features such as
touch-screen multimedia control
systems for in-car entertainment, or
additional safety systems, such as
technology that warns about lane
departure and potential collisions.
Phone manufacturers, such as
Samsung and Apple, use planned
obsolescence to increase revenue
by persuading consumers to replace
still-usable cell phones or tablets
with something newer and better.
In this highly competitive market,
the rewards go to the company that
creates planned obsolescence

fastest rates of replacement
purchase. Samsung has used
this strategy to great effect to
boost proﬁts. In July 2013 the

beginning of each season, most
teams release at least two replica
uniforms for fans to buy. The home

noticeably different from last

planned obsolescence is based on
status anxiety. Many fans will
choose to buy the new shirt to keep

loyalty to their team, even though
the shirt that they bought a year

Comparing approaches
Traditionally, companies have
pushed new products through a
linear sequence of development,
where each department involved
in the design works in isolation,
completing their task before
passing the product to the next
department. In this way, the partmade product might move between
design, engineering, and
production departments.
However, this approach can lead
to time-consuming mistakes. For
example, when new cars are being

might work on various parts in

Benchmarking in practice
In the 1980s, the US photocopier
manufacturer Xerox used
benchmarking to restore its market
share. For ten years, it had been
losing customers to its Japanese
rivals Canon and Ricoh. These
companies had been gaining
ground because they were able to
undercut the prices charged by
Xerox, without compromising on
product quality. To identify what
they were doing wrong, Xerox
bought their rivals’ products and
took them apart. They discovered
that Canon and Ricoh designed their
machines so that they were made
from a relatively small number of

production methods. Upon their
return, the team members adopted
many of the production methods
they had seen. Benchmarking
also enabled Xerox to improve
the reliability of its products. From
1981 to 1990, customer complaints
fell by 60 percent. Over the same
period Xerox’s manufacturing
costs fell by more than 50 percent,
which enabled the company to
match the prices charged by the
Japanese, while maintaining its
proﬁt margins.

Raising standards
simplicity enabled the competition
to beneﬁt from economies of scale;
bulk-buying components reduced
operating costs, making it possible
for Canon and Ricoh to offer
consumers lower prices. Xerox
responded by simplifying its
designs, so that the commonality

rose from 20 to 70 percent.

Ferrari’s pit-stop crew has a clear
chain of command, allowing them to
refuel the car and change all four
tires in less than seven seconds.

Some companies learn from
another organization that operates
in a completely different market.
For example, in 2005, two doctors
from London’s Great Ormond
Street children’s hospital were
struck by the efﬁciency of the
Ferrari pit crew during a Formula
1 race.
Alan Goldman and Martin
Elliot observed that only one
person in the crew gave orders,
avoiding time lost in discussion,
and pit-stop routines were
standardized. Crew members

specialized in one task, which
they practiced over and over,
until it was perfect.
Goldman and Elliot changed
working arrangements at Great
Ormond Street by applying
Ferrari best practice: clear job
descriptions meant that each
member of staff knew what
their role was, and a leadership
position was assigned for each
shift. As a result, patient
handover errors between the
operating room and intensive
care unit unit fell by 70 percent.

usiness is all about succeeding, often against considerable odds,
and to do so its practitioners have drawn on a range of insights
from a number of related disciplines. It requires an understanding
of people, numbers, and systems, so it is perhaps not surprising that a
large proportion of its key thinkers come from the ﬁelds of psychology,
mathematics, and engineering. Some of them have proved adept at turning
theory into practice, building large businesses that continue to evolve and
grow over the long term. The main part of this book has examined the
work of some of those key thinkers in detail; here we look at others whose
impact on the business environment is marked, from industrial designers
and theorists to inspirational leaders and management gurus.

RICHARD BRANSON
1950–
Founder of the Virgin Group of
businesses, Richard Branson was
born in 1950 in Surrey, UK. In 1969
he started a mail-order record
company called Virgin, which then
expanded into retail stores. In 1972
he built a recording studio, and
began his own record label. The
Virgin brand expanded into diverse
areas, and the Virgin Group today
consists of more than 200 companies
in more than 30 countries,
including Virgin Atlantic airlines,

The Ice Cream Maker. This approach
says that by making “quality” the
responsibility of every employee,
individual quality leads to process
quality and organizational success.
